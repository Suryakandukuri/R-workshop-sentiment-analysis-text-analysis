These phablets are not as powerful as the Note 5, but they're worth trying out because they come with a reasonable price and their cameras do a great job. We'll compare the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy E7 and we'll see which one has better specs.
Designs and Displays
The Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy E7 still look like most of the old Samsung phones, because their have a shiny plastic back, they're slippery and prone to fingerprints. The good news is that the frame is made of aluminum, so it's more durable and it doesn't deteriorate so easily.
Both phablets come with a Super AMOLED screen that has the same size of 5.5-inch and resolution of 720 x 1280 pixels, which results in a pixel density of 267ppi. But that doesn't mean that the dimensions of their bodies are identical, because the J7 is taller, wider, thicker and heavier, measuring 152.2 x 78.7 x 7.5 mm and weighting 171 grams, while the E7 measures 151.3 x 77.2 x 7.3 mm and weights 141 grams. Also, both phones have the rear camera located in the center, while the LED flash sits in front of it.
Hardware
The J7 has superior internal hardware, being available in two variants of processors: the 64bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset is powered by two quad core processors running at 1.4GHz and 1GHz respectively, which are backed by an Adreno 405 GPU, while the other variant uses an Exynos 7580 octa core processor clocked at 1.5GHz, which is paired with Mali-T720MP2 graphics. Both models support 1.5GB of RAM and are housing an internal memory of 16GB, whose capacity can be increased up to 128GB.
There's another story with the E7, which has a much weaker Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, but which is backed by 2GB of RAM. Also, the graphics are older - Adreno 306, but the internal memory is identical. The maximum expandable memory size is 64GB and the device uses SIM 2 slot.
Cameras and Batteries
Both the J7 and E7 have a rear camera with a resolution of 13MP (supporting autofocus, LED flash, HDR, 1080p video capture @30fps) and a front camera of 5MP, but only the first phablet is equipped with LED flash, to take better selfies at night.
The batteries have a similar capacity. The J7 has a 3000mAh unit which can be removed, while the E7 is stuck with a 2950mAh battery, but these devices should last 18 hours when making calls over 3G.
Prices
In India, the Galaxy J7 is sold for the price of 227 dollars, while the E7 costs 244 dollars.

This smartphone was launched in June, in India, but it didn't receive as much as attention as it deserves, because everyone was more interested in the Galaxy flagships, the J7 is a mid-range phablet which costs Rs. 14,999 ($230) and it came along with the smaller J5, which whose price is Rs. 11,999 ($185). One of the biggest advantages of these phones is the gaming capability, because they're using 4G LTE connectivity and the users can get of in-game credits from Gameloft.
In this article we'll present you the Galaxy J7, which came loaded with Android 5.1.1. It has an anodized body and faux-metal side bezels which look cheap, and the design is similar to most of Samsung's mid-range phones. The phablet doesn't feel as comfortable to hold as the J5 because of its taller body, but at least it's very slim, measuring 7.5mm. The phone is available in three variants of colors: White, Black and Gold, it weights 171grams and it has a Super AMOLED screen which measures 5.5-inch. The colors look pretty saturated and vibrant, but the screen is not too sharp because the resolution is 720×1280 pixels at 267ppi.
The phone is available in two variants of 64bit processors, so you can choose either the Qualcomm MSM8939 Snapdragon 615 octa core with four cores running at 1.4GHz and four cores running at 1GHz, or the model with an Exynos 7580 octa core processor clocked at 1.5GHz. Whatever variant you'll buy, you'll get 1.5GB of RAM and a microSd card slot to expand the internal memory of 16GB up to 128GB.
You'll take pictures with the impressive 13MP rear camera which has an aperture of f/1.9, but Samsung has added only basic features such as LED flash and autofocus, plus eight modes for Auto, Pro, Panorama, Continuous Shot, Beauty Face, Sound and Shot, Sports and HDR. When switching to the front camera (5MP), you'll see more modes and one is for Wide-Selfie shots. The Continuous Mode and Pro mode don't work as great as they should, but overall, the quality of the images is pretty good.
Its battery has a capacity of 3000mAh and it helps the device last longer than other competitors. Also, the unit is removable and according to ForeArena, it offers 33 hours and 19 minutes of talktime, 6 hours and 40 minutes of browsing over 3G, 8 hours and 20 minutes of WiFi browsing and 12 hours and 30 minutes of video playback.

The models launched also do not support TDD-LTE Band 40 (2300MHz) for 4G LTE in India, and only the FDD-LTE Band 3 (1800MHz).
Update: While the specifications initially provided by Samsung India did not  mention support for 2300MHz TDD-LTE Band 40, Samsung has confirmed to  NDTV Gadgets that the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 smartphones do indeed  support this band as well as 1800MHz FDD-LTE Band 3.

The South Korean giant has also partnered with Airtel to provide an introductory offer for 4G users which will include double data offer. Customers will also get unlimited music download worth Rs. 594 through Wynk Music app for a period of 6 months.
The  Android 5.1-based smartphones are dual-SIM dual standby handsets that  will be available in Black, White, and Gold colours. Both smartphones feature front-facing LED flash, the first handsets from the company to do so, making them selfie-focus smartphones.
The Samsung  Galaxy J5 features a 5-inch Super Amoled display (instead of the TFT LCD display launched in China) with a HD screen resolution of 720x1280 pixels. The smartphone is backed by 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon  410 SoC coupled with 1.5GB of RAM. The Indian model features 8GB of built-in storage instead of the Chinese model's 16GB, and it is further expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB).

"5",5,"Samsung Galaxy J5, Galaxy J7 India Launch Expected at Thursday Event
by NDTV Correspondent , 14 July 2015
Samsung has sent invites for an event in New Delhi on  Thursday, where the South Korean consumer electronics giant is expected  to launch its newly unveiled Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 selfie-focused  smartphones.
The company's invite for the event on Thursday  features an image of a smartphone, along with the caption, ""Unveiling of  the latest stars in the Galaxy series."" With a front-facing flash  module clearly visible in the image, Samsung appears to be pointing to  the launch of its only smartphones with front-facing LED flash - the  Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 - though the module is placed differently.
The Samsung Galaxy J5 and Samsung Galaxy  J7 were launched first in China last month, priced at CNY 1,398 (roughly  Rs. 14,300) and CNY 1,798 (roughly Rs. 18,400) respectively. The  Android 5.1-based smartphones are dual-SIM dual standby handsets that  will be available in Black, White, and Gold colours.
The Samsung  Galaxy J5 features a 5-inch TFT display with a HD screen resolution of  1280x720 pixels. The smartphone is backed by 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon  410 SoC coupled with 1.5GB of RAM. There is 16GB of built-in storage,  which is further expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB).
It  packs a 2600mAh battery, which is rated to deliver standby time of 342  hours. It sports a 13-megapixel rear autofocus camera with f/1.9  aperture and 5-megapixel front camera.

The Samsung  Galaxy J7 features similar specifications to the Galaxy J5. The only  differences in the Galaxy J7 are the larger 5.5-inch TFT display with  the same resolution, an octa-core Snapdragon 615 (four 1.4GHz cores +  four 1GHz cores), and a 3000mAh battery rated to deliver 354 hours of  standby time. The smartphone measures 152.2x79.1x7.9mm and weighs 168  grams.

All year, Samsung has been in the spotlight with its new glass and metal flagships, starting with the Galaxy S6 and ending with the Galaxy Note 5, but that doesn't mean that the company hasn't worked on other models in parallel. In fact, in September, the South Korean manufacturer has announced a pair of new mid-range devices, the Galaxy J7 phablet and the smaller J5. But in June, the company has launched the much smaller J5, which isn't a lot more advanced than the A3, which was released in December 2014. To give you an idea about how different they are, we've made a comparison between them.
Designs and Displays
The Galaxy J2 looks more like the first Samsung smartphones which came with a polycarbonate coarse-textured back, with curved edges and a wide frame curved on the sides, which, this time, is made of metal. On the front side, you'll see the familiar oval home button which is surrounded by capacitive buttons, but the phone lacks a fingerprint scanner. The dimensions are 136.5x69x8.4mm, but its weight hasn't been specified. The screen measures 4.7-inch and it's a Super AMOLED supporting a resolution of 540×960 pixels at 234ppi and you'll easily operate on it with one hand.
The A3 has a more premium appearance, having a slimmer body which is made of metal. The back and the sides are flat and there are a bunch of color options for the metallic construction: Midnight Black, Pearl White, Platinum Silver, Soft Pink, Light Blue and Champagne Gold, while the J2 is available only in White, Black and Gold. And the dimensions of the A3 are 130.1×65.5×6.9mm, but despite of the metal body, the phone has a weight of only 110grams. But the screen is even smaller at 4.5-inch and it supports also a resolution of 540x960pixels with 245ppi, which means that it's sharper.
Hardware
None of the devices have impressive processors, but at least they have four cores. However, the J2 uses an old Exynos 3475 quad core Cortex-A7 processor clocked at 1.3GHz, which is backed by Mali-T720 graphics and 1GB of RAM, but Samsung could have been more generous with the internal memory, because it has a capacity of only 8GB, so if you want to install more applications, you'll need to do it on the microSD card, because the maximum supported size is 128GB.
The A3 uses a Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 quad core 1.2GHz Cortex-A53 processor which works with an Adreno 306 GPU. The good news is that if you don't have enough money to get the model with 1.5GB of RAM, there's another variant which supports 1GB of RAM. The phone's internal memory is also expandable, but the initial capacity is 16GB and it can be increased up to 64GB.
Cameras and Batteries
The J2 doesn't excel in the camera department, because Samsung didn't intend to make this device amazing, so the resolutions of the two cameras were limited to 5MP and 2MP and the features are standard, nothing spectacular about them.
The A3 offers an 8MP back camera and a 5MP front camera, which inherited the same features, only that the phone is capable of recording Full HD videos.
As for the batteries, Samsung went back to a removable unit and its capacity is 2000mAh, but it isn't known how much it lasts. The A3 has a uni-body design, which makes the battery non-removable. That's sad, because its capacity is only 1900mAh.
Prices
In India, the J2 can be found at a price of 130 dollars, while the A3 can be bought from Amazon, where it costs 180 dollars.

NEW DELHI: Flipkart, the country's largest online retailer and marketplace, sold more than $200 million worth of mobile phones during the five-day Big Billion Days sale, with most consumers demanding 4G-backed devices, a top executive said.
Mobile phones made up two-thirds of the $300 million worth of products purchased by consumers during the sale, which started on October 13. Flipkart sold 250 mobile phones every minute, of which 190 were 4G phones, during the five days, chief business officer Ankit Nagori said.
""Today, three of four phones, which we sell on Flipkart are 4G phones,"" said Nagori. ""About 80% of sale of mobile phones that happened during Big Billion Days were actually 4G phones. Overall, 80% of the phones sold would be under Rs 10,000 range.""
He said Flipkart was the largest marketplace in the country for mobile phones. During last year's one-day Big Billion Day event, it sold $60 million worth of mobile phones.
The company's overall smartphone sales mirror that of the Indian market, which is expected to overtake the US as the second-fastest growing market, after China, by 2017. According to Counterpoint Technology Market Research, almost 30% of the smartphones sold in India during the April to June quarter were through online channels. Smartphones sold only online contributed to more than 20% of the total. More than half of these exclusively online sales were on Flipkart, it added.
""Our smartphone numbers have grown in very high triple digits over the last one year but we don't share exact numbers. But I can say that all the growth is coming from 4G phones,"" Nagori added. Some of the top-selling 4G handsets during Flipkart's sale were Lenovo K3 Note, Moto G3, Samsung Galaxy J5 and J7. The company said most of the 4G phone demand came from Maharashtra, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu and Gujarat.
The spurt in sales of 4G phones was on account of their attractive pricing -- most were available in the affordable segment of Rs 7,500 to Rs 15,000 and became even cheaper after discounts. Today, 4G phones start at Rs 4,990.
Flipkart has sold about 6 million 4G handsets since such affordable devices entered India about 10 months ago, exceeding the number of users of the high-speed data service across networks in the country. On an average, 7-8 million smartphones are sold every month.
The high sales may push mobile carriers to widen the availability of 4G services. Bharti Airtel, India's No. 1 carrier, has launched its 4G service in hundreds of cities, while Aircel has rolled it out in a few. No. 2 Vodafone is set to start the service by the year end and No. 3 carrier Idea Cellular will offer it in 750 cities by June 2016.
""There's a very large chunk of customers who are buying 4G phones because they want their phones to be future-ready,"" Nagori said. ""So, even when 4G networks are not rolled out across the country, no one wants to buy an inferior phone.""
Flipkart also expects users of entry-level or affordable 4G phones to upgrade to premium phones. ""A lot of customers will start moving towards higher end phones and Flipkart is enabling that by providing products exchange, seamless buyback...ownership cycles are going down from 12-18 months to 9-12 months in the next one year,"" he said.

In one of the most action packed weeks of late, our Top 10 trending phones chart has been shaken too. No less than 4 new entrants have made it into the top 10 and, believe it or not, one of them storms straight to the top.
The Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) is found in tenth, keeping the Samsung Galaxy A8 out by an inch. Long time podium finisher Galaxy Grand Prime is a notch above in ninth.
The just-released Huawei Nexus 6P is the first of the new additions to the Top 10 chart and is found in eighth spot. The Galaxy Note5 drops four positions and is now in seventh behind the J5. It's the other Nexus, the LG-made 5X, that joins the race in fifth, barely outstripped by the all-new (and rather intriguing) LG V10.
Moving on to the top three, we find that the Galaxy J7 has surrendered its second place from last week and is now in third. The iPhone 6s has climbed up four spots and is now runner-up by number of hits, comfortably ahead of the J7, but equally far from the top.
And this week's number one most researched phone is, out of nowhere, the Samsung Galaxy J2. The affordable 4.7-incher was announced a few weeks ago as part of the Make for India initiative, and we'd guess its recent market launch is the event that's fueled its rise to prominence in this week's Top 10 trending chart.

Samsung Galaxy J7 Review Better Than Moto G 3rd Gen. AllAboutTechnologies Twitter image. Sept. 11, 2015.
Samsung announced its Galaxy J7 smartphone back in June and released it in China on the same month. It was made available in India in July.
The Samsung Galaxy J7, which has been in the market since June, has offered users mid-range specs for a relatively low price, considering the handset comes from a popular brand known for manufacturing premiere smartphones.
The Galaxy J7, which began shipping out in July 24, is a 5.5-inch handset with a 720 x 1280 resolution Super AMOLED capacitive touchscreen over a 1.5GHz Exynos 7580 chipset and an Adreno 405 GPU, both of which are supported by 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of onboard storage, expandable up to 128GB via a microSD slot.
The Galaxy J7 runs on Android 5.1 Lollipop, and features a 13MP primary camera with a LED flash and autofocus that supports face detection, touch focus, geo-tagging, and panorama shots, as well as a 5MP secondary front camera, also with a LED flash.
Supported with Wi-Fi, Wi-Fi direct, and hotspot capabilities, it also has Bluetooth, GPS, 4G LTE, 3G, and NFC, and is juiced by a 3,000mAh battery.
Measuring 152.4mm x 78.6mm x 7.50mm, the Galaxy J7 weighs 171g, and comes in white, black and gold variants.
The phone boasts of an Ultra Power Saving Mode which helps to cut down on its battery's power consumption by automatically shutting down the handset's unnecessary functions when not in use. It also features a Smart Manager that helps users check their memory and battery status, delete unused files, and run their phone through antivirus checks.

In China the J7 smartphones run on Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipsets, compared to the Exynos 7580 processors in the J7 Indian units.

Samsung launched two mid-range smartphones in June, the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5, to warm consumer reception, and actually signal the Korean tech giant's response to the heavy hitters in the global mid-range handset currently dominated by Motorola, Sony, Xiaomi, among other players.
Although it is affordably priced just like the other mid-range smartphones including the Xiaomi Mi 4i, the Motorola Moto G 2nd Generation, the Sony Xperia E 4G, among several others, Samsung has evidently raised the bar in the market with the superb specifications and features of its Galaxy J series smartphones, notes Gadgets NDTV.
The mid-range smartphones both run on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box and both came out on its home market in South Korea followed by its biggest market in China in June, before making it to India in July and other Asian markets.
Just like the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, Samsung launched the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Samsung Galaxy J5 to validate its reputation for simultaneously launching products that are almost similarly priced and features.
Stirring up a storm
However, the Samsung Galaxy J7 is the more top-of-the-line variant between the two mid-range handsets and reports have it that when it was launched in June, it has stirred a storm in the mid-range market segment.
The Galaxy J7 is larger than the Galaxy J5 with its 5.5-inch screen compared to the latter's 5-inch display screen. However, both have the same 720 x 1280-pixel resolution
In terms of power under the hood, the Galaxy J7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 610 chipset while the Galaxy J5 features the slightly inferior Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. The Snapdragon 610 is an octa-core processor while the Snapdragon 410 is only quad-core.
However, the version of the Samsung Galaxy J7 that came out in India is powered by a 1.5GHz octa-core Exynos 7480 processor with 1.5GB of RAM. It also comes with a Mali T720MP2 GPU to ensure great graphics, notes MakTech Blog.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 comes with a 16GB built-in storage that is expandable up to 128GB using microSD card.
The versions of the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 that came out in India were running on Android 5.1 Lollipop and not on the much later Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.
Similarities and differences
The smartphones also have similar cameras. Both smartphones feature a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera that comes with a range of functionalities including face detection, autofocus, and LED flash.
In terms of memory, both the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 feature internal memory and an external memory card. While the high-end variants of the Samsung smartphones have started doing away with the external memory card support altogether, but these features have been maintained with both midrange handsets.
The Galaxy J5 is also lighter than the Galaxy J7 as it weighs only 145 grams compared to the latter which weighs 171 grams. The weight difference is attributed basically to the battery that each device is using.
When the two midrange handsets came out in the Indian retail market, the Samsung Galaxy J7 came with a retail price of $230.45 while the Samsung Galaxy J5 is worth $184.36.
Both the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Samsung Galaxy J5 are being positioned by the Korean tech giant as an affordable device for gamers as they can potentially deliver smooth online gaming experience using 4G LTE connectivity.
Samsung has partnered with Airtel 4G so that both the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 would receive double Airtel 4G LTE data along with unlimited music downloads through the Wynk Music app.

This week Samsung's Galaxy J series locked out the podium. The J7, J5 and J2  in that order  make up the Top 3 smartphones by interest over the last 7 days.
That's not a huge surprise, the Galaxy J7 was first last week too and the Galaxy J5 was second. The Galaxy J2 had the top spot a couple of weeks ago, but last week it dropped sharply to 9th only to recover quickly. The J2 went on sale on Flipkart and Amazon India on October 9, which may be behind its sudden jolt of popularity.
The Samsung Galaxy Grand Prime is on the rise again, going from 9th to 5th and now 4th over the last couple of weeks. Some North American carriers have some good deals on it, but it's an old model so we're not sure how it got so popular.
Then there's the Galaxy Note 5, which has been fluctuating lately. There was a promo on eBay for unlocked units a few days ago, but it's mostly holding tight until Samsung's phablet finally launches in Europe.
The Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) is rising up the ranks, perhaps boosted by the confirmation that it will get Android 6.0 Marshmallow (its Moto E sibling will not).
After the initial explosion, Apple iPhone 6s interest has been waning, but it is doing much better than its large sibling, which isnt even in the Top 20.
The Sony Xperia Z5 was Top 3 last week, shortly after it became available to consumers. Now it's barely holding on and is currently 9th. Guess those James Bond themed promos don't have much staying power.

Can Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo topple Sony Xperia M5 as the true affordable flagship of India?
MID-RANGE SMARTPHONES , SAMSUNG , SONY XPERIA
Sony's affordable flagship, the five-inch Xperia M5, may have met its match with the launch of Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo - another 'affordable flagship' from the Korean company.
The Galaxy S5 Neo, which is reportedly being prepped to be released in India at a price of Rs 25,000-30,000 towards the end of this month, could give would-be Xperia M5 buyers second thoughts.
Even atRs 30,000 - the upper end of the indicated price range - the Galaxy Neo is a value for money offering when compared with Xperia M5, which is also a five-incher and is selling for Rs 34,000 in India right now.
Neo's Advantages
One of the key advantages of the S5 Neo over the Xperia M5 is display quality. The Neo comes with a full-HD AMOLED panel, while the M5 has an LCD panel of the same resolution.
While the Samsung model may look slightly plain compared to the M5, it's a different matter when looking at the two with the naked eye and with the screens switched on.
Other advantages of the Neo is a slightly bigger screen (5.1 inch vs 5.0 inch), a more updated operating system (Android 5.1 vs 5.0) and longer battery life. The phone offers a stated battery life of 15 hours on 3G, while the M5 offers only 12 hours. This is partly due to the bigger, 2.8 Ah battery compared to a 2.6 Ah one on the Sony model.
The Korean company has also made some appearance tweaks to the phone (compared with the original S5) keeping user feedback in mind (see picture from http://winfuture.de at the top.)
M5's advantages
However, if you care more about photographic excellence compared to display colors, the M5 manages to outdo the Samsung model.
Sony's cameras are reputed to be better than those of Samsung, and the M5 comes with a 21 MP shooter that can record 4K video, while the Samsung model will have a 16 MP camera which records up to full-HD video. In other words, there is no comparison in the camera department.
The Xperia has certain other advantages as well. For example, it comes with the tried-and-tested MT6795 Helio X10 processor, while the Samsung model comes with a slightly Exynos 7580, which is also found in the Galaxy J7 (priced at just Rs 14,999).
Though Antutu scores of both platforms are largely similar at around 35,000, the M5 does offer 3 GB of RAM instead of the 2 GB found on the S5 Neo.
In addition, the waterproofing on the Sony model is more robust. The M5 comes with IP68 certification, implying that the phone will work in water of up to to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. The Neo, on the other hand, has IP67 certification, implying water resistance in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes.
Onboard storage memory in both phones is 16 GB, and both come with support for MicroSD cards, which sets them apart from certain Chinese models such as Meizu MX5 and OnePlus Two.
Flipkart Exclusive?
However, the Galaxy S5 Neo may yet have one more trump card up its sleeve - pricing. Going by market buzz, the Samsung could price the phone in the Rs 25,000 range if it makes it an online exclusive. At that price, the phone would also take on the OnePlus Two, which is priced at Rs 24,999 for a 32 GB model with no expandable memory.
The original Galaxy S5 was released February 2014 and came with no 3G - a factor which hampered its sales in India. The phone is available in today's market at Rs 22,000.
Sony Xperia Z5 available on eBay India, to hit Amazon, Flipkart next week Sony's flagship Z5 has hit online marketplace eBay at a steep Rs 51,900, but is slated to be available at cheaper prices in the coming week on rival platforms like Amazon and Flipkart.

"21",21,"Samsung Galaxy J7 Listed by Online Retailer Ahead of Launch
by NDTV Correspondent , 8 June 2015
Samsung seems to be gearing up to introduce a new Galaxy Android  smartphone, the Galaxy J7, which has gone up for pre-orders via an  online retailer. So far, there has been no announcement on the launch of  the Samsung Galaxy J7.
According to the Kazakhstan-based online retailer , the Galaxy J7 is available to pre-order at KZT 49,990  (approximately Rs. 17,250). The online retailer however suggests that  the smartphone's sale is expected to start in August only.
The  online retailer lists some of the specifications of the Samsung Galaxy  J7 including a 5.5-inch HD (720X1280 pixels) TFT LCD display; a  13-megapixel rear camera; a 5-megapixel front camera; an octa-core  Marvell PXA1936 processor clocked at 1.2GHz (the retailer also lists a  clock speed of 1.4GHz in some places); 1.5GB of RAM, and 16GB of inbuilt  storage. The handset supports expandable storage via microSD card (up  to 128GB). The listing also suggests that the Galaxy J7 runs Android  5.0.2 Lollipop.
Of course since this is a third-party store, one  cannot be certain if this is the launch price or exact specifications,  whenever the Samsung Galaxy J7 is officially unveiled.
Earlier  this month, Samsung's Galaxy S6 Active was briefly listed  on the company site with specifications. As per the Samsung US'  support page, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active features the same set of  specifications as its original flagship variant, the Samsung Galaxy S6 . The  handset features 5.1-inch Quad HD (1440x2560 pixels) Super Amoled  display and is powered by company's own octa-core Exynos 7420 SoC.
The  Samsung Galaxy S6 Active comes with 32GB of inbuilt storage, besides a  16-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The  smartphone is seen backed by a 2550mAh non-removable battery. Also, the  device measures and weighs the same as the Galaxy S6 - 143.5x70.6x6.85mm  and 138 grams. Notably, the company is yet to reveal the Galaxy S6  Active.

The Samsung Galaxy J7 has a 13 megapixel primary camera with auto-focus, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama, flash, and video recording at 1080p at 30 fps. For selfies, it offers a 5 megapixel front camera.
The Asus Zenfone 2 might have more features, but since the specs are so closely matched, we will wait to call a winner till a real world test.
Connectivity
The Asus ZenFone 2 is a dual-SIM 4G phone with WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS with GLONASS, and NFC.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 also has dual-SIM, 4G, GPS (A-GPS and GLONASS), Bluetooth 4.1.1, WiFi, and NFC.
Wrapping up
We feel that the Asus is the better package overall, as it has better looks, a higher resolution display, and higher processing ability. The Samsung does have the edge when it comes to the screen size and storage, while camera, battery, and connectivity remain equal.

In a recent post, we've told you that Samsung would reveal its Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 - exactly today. And they did the same. From today, the Galaxy J5 and J7 have been made official in India and the pricing of the two handsets have also been announced. The Galaxy J5 will have a 5-inches screen supported by a Snapdragon 410 chipset, quad-core CPU running at a processing speed of 1.2GHz. The average price for this device will be Rs. 11,999.
With the Galaxy J7, you will have a much bigger smartphone with a 5.5-inches screen, running on Snapdragon 615 chipset with a four-cores 1.4 GHz CPU and you would have to give Rs. 14,999 in exchange.
Both of them will have a on-board 13-megapixels rear camera and a 5-megapixels front shooter, accompanied by a series of LED bulbs. Both are equipped with 1.5-gigabytes of RAM, an internal memory bank of 16-gigabytes and will be able to accommodate another 128-gigabytes via microSD card. Both the Galaxy J5 and J7 will have access to 4G LTE, 3G Connection, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.1 and GPS. Android 5.1 Lollipop will be at your service as you pick it up along the way.

Samsung Galaxy J7 4G to take on Lenovo A7000 in India, price Rs 14,000
ENTRY-LEVEL SMARTPHONES , HUAWEI , LENOVO , MID-RANGE SMARTPHONES , NEW PHONES , SAMSUNG , XIAOMI
So you thought Lenovo, Xiaomi and Huawei are going to run-away with the low-priced LTE market in India and Samsung would just stand aside and watch?
It seems that may be a wrong assessment as the Samsung Galaxy J7, arguably the most value-for-money offering from the Korean giant in recent years, will set the record straight.
In terms of specifications, the Galaxy J7 is almost exactly the same as the Lenovo A7000 and Huawei Honor 4X. The only major deviation is that while the Lenovo and Huawei models have 2 GB of RAM, the Galaxy J7 has only 1.5 GB of RAM. However, that is unlikely to make a huge difference in many consumers' eyes.
UPDATE: Prices of Galaxy J5 will be around Rs 11,500 and J7 around Rs 14,500.
The Samsung J7 represents a huge leap forward in the company's attempt to target price-sensitive buyers. Just one year ago, such a phone from Samsung would have cost Rs 20,000.
The J7, like the Lenovo A7000 and Honor 4x, is also a 5.5-inch model. Like the others, it too comes with a 720p HD display. Unlike the E7, priced at Rs 19,000, the J7 does not come with an AMOLED display but a normal LCD screen, and this is seen bringing down the price of the J7 by about Rs 4,000 compared to the E7.
According to our source, Samsung could further optimize its pricing to the Rs 12,500-13,000 range if it chooses to tie-up with Amazon as it had for the launch of its J1 back in February.
At the time, Amazon had launched the phone at just Rs 7,199. But when the J1 became available with other retailers, it was priced at Rs 7,600. The cost of distribution using online retail is much lower than that of traditional retail, and therefore, companies are able to price their handsets lower on e-commerce portals.
However, there is no clarity yet on whether Samsung would go for a tie-up with Amazon for the J7 as well. ""If it does, it can bring down the retail price by 1,000-1,500 rupees,"" said an industry source. Even without such a tie-up, Samsung is likely to price the phone aggressively in the Rs 14,000-15,000 range to see off competition from the A7000, Honor 4x etc.
One of the differentiators of the J7 will be its processor. For the model, Samsung has chosen to tap chipmaker Marvel, popular in China, but a newcomer to the Indian market.
The Galaxy J7 will be powered by the Marvel PXA1936 octa-core processor with 64-bit support and built-in LTE. In terms of power, the PXA1936 is comparable to the MediaTek MT6752 processor that lies inside the Lenovo A7000.
The phone will be launched in India before the end of April. No word, yet, on when the Galaxy J5 will be launched. Besides, there is much confusion about the configuration of the J5.
The higher-end Galaxy E5 is priced at Rs 16,000, and the J5 will have to be priced in the Rs 12,000 range to make it attractive viz a viz the E5. The key difference between the J series phones and the E series phones is the display technology.
The E series come with AMOLED displays, while the J series come with normal LCD displays. AMOLED displays offer better color and contrast as each 'dot' emits its own light, unlike LCD panels, where the light is emitted by a panel of LEDs behind the screen.
The point of confusion about the J5 is the underlying processor. While many expect it to be Snapdragon 410, chances are that the model would also come with Marvel PXA1936.
Samsung's new line-up consists of the following sub-brands:
Top-end 'S' Series, which will be priced around Rs 50,000 for regular versions and Rs 40,000 for the compact versions.
The high-end 'A' Series, of which the A3, A5 and A7 have already been released, and the A9 is expected soon. This will be aimed at the value-conscious buyer who does not want to compromise on specifications. As a result, all top-end specifications, such as LTE, quad-HD displays etc, will be found in this category. However, in terms of looks and processor-capability, the Galaxy A series would trail the S series. Both the A5 and the A7 come with LTE. The A9 is expected to come with a quad-HD display.
The A5 was priced around Rs 25,000, while the A7 is priced at around Rs 30,500 at launch. The A9 is expected to be priced around the Rs 36,000 mark.
The Galaxy E Series is meant for the 'mid range' market, where people are willing to compromise on specifications to save money. The E7, which is a 5.5-inch model, is priced at Rs 19,500, while the E5, a 5-inch model, is priced at Rs 16,000. Neither have LTE, and come with 720p displays super AMOLED displays.
The entry level Android phones would be launched under the 'Galaxy J Series' brand. Being entry level, the display will not be super Amoled, but PLS LCD. Only the J1 has been launched yet, and is priced at Rs 7,200, with both J5 and J7 in the pipeline.
Microsoft Lumia 950 XL India launch could miss Diwali, price around Rs 55k; 550 cheapest For all practical purposes, Microsoft's Lumia brand has been dead in the Indian market for the last six months.  At present, the highest-rated phone from the company is the Lumia 930, a 3G-only phone priced at Rs 38,000 and launched more than a year ago.

"27",27,"Moto G 3rd gen vs Samsung Galaxy J7 price and specs
August 23, 2015
By Debbie Turner Leave a Comment
There were plenty of people waiting for the new Moto G 2015 to release and Motorola duly obliged with the Moto G 3rd gen.  This is an affordable smartphone and one of its competitors is likely to be a recent Samsung arrival, the Galaxy J7.  Today we're comparing the Moto G 3rd gen vs Samsung Galaxy J7 in a price and specs shootout.
The 3rd gen Moto G is widely available in various regions worldwide and is available in single SIM or dual SIM options.  The Galaxy J7 released first in China and more recently went on sale in India, and could be making its way to further markets.  We'll consider the key specs and more of each, including pricing, to show what they have to offer.
Processors
The Moto G 3rd gen has a 1.4GHz Snapdragon 410 quad-core processor and Adreno 306 graphics.  The Samsung Galaxy J7 is powered by a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor (4 cores at 1.4GHz and 4 at 1GHz) with Adreno 405 GPU.  Alternatively for some markets the Galaxy J7 has a 1.5GHz Exynos 7580 octa-core processor and Mali-T720MP2 graphics.
Display
The Motorola phone has a 5-inch IPS LCD display with HD resolution of 1280 x 720 resulting in 294 ppi.  The Galaxy J7 has a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display also with HD resolution, this time resulting in 267 ppi.
RAM and Storage
The Moto G 3rd gen comes in two variants.  One has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage and the other has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage.  Both are expandable to 32GB via microSD.  The Samsung phone has 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, expandable with microSD to 128GB.
Camera set-up
There's not much between them here as both handsets have a 13-megapixel rear camera with 1080p video capture, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera.  However, the new Moto G has dual-LED flash while the Samsung phone has a single flash, but the Galaxy J7 also has flash for the front-facing camera which the Moto G lacks.
Battery
The Moto G 3rd gen has a non-removable 2470 mAh battery.  The Galaxy J7 has a removable 3000 mAh battery.
Connectivity
The Moto G 3rd gen supports 4G LTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n with WiFi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, microUSB 2.0 and USB Host.  The Galaxy J7 has 4G LTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n with WiFi hotspot, WiFi Direct, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, and microUSB 2.0.
Operating System
The latest Moto G runs virtually stock Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.  The Galaxy J7 runs Android 5.1.
Dimensions and Weight
The Motorola phone is thicker but lighter.  It measures 142.1mm x 72.4mm x 11.6mm and weighs 155g.  The Galaxy handset measures 152.2mm x 78.7mm x 7.5mm and weighs 171g.
Price
Pricing will vary according to market and retailers but generally the Samsung phone is the more expensive of the two.  For example in India the Moto G 3rd is priced at Rs. 11,999 for the lesser storage model or Rs. 12,999 for the 2GB RAM variant.  In the US the Moto G 3rd gen 1GB is priced at $179 or the 2GB model is $219.99.  Meanwhile the Samsung Galaxy J7 is priced at Rs. 14,999 in India.  It hasn't launched in the US (yet?) but the Chinese price equivalent equates to approximately $289 while the equivalent of the India price is around $226.
These companies are both big brand names, and both have plenty of loyal fans that will choose between them purely on that basis.  Potential buyers should also consider their preference of design and build, but we have to say that the higher price of the Samsung phone is reflected in the specs.  For example the Galaxy J7 has an octa-core processor, larger display, a higher level of expandable storage, and higher capacity battery that's also removable.  It's also a much slimmer handset.
The Moto G 3rd gen still has plenty to offer for its cheaper price tag though, including a later version of Android.  Although it's notably bulkier its overall size is more compact, and some buyers may prefer this.  Another benefit of the Moto G 3rd gen is water-resistance.  Of course it also has the advantage of a lower price, although the difference in pricing will vary by market.
When you have considered the above we'd be interested to hear which of these phones gets your vote.  Are you more likely to purchase the Moto G 3rd gen or the Samsung Galaxy J7?

After the successful launching of its Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge in March this year, the Korean tech giant has reinforced its reputation as a flagship smartphone maker and one of the best in the industry in producing high-end handsets.
However, Samsung is well aware of the fact that the high-end smartphone market is relatively small compared to the midrange handset category.
Over the years, Samsung has covered much of the smartphone market spectrum with the exception of the low-end market category, sort of leaving the crumbs to the small market players.
Samsung is actually the foremost rival of Apple in producing high-end and pricey smartphones and other gadgets, but it has been doing something that the American tech giant cannot and will never do. Samsung has a presence in the midrange handset category and Apple does not have it.
It has produced smartphones to cater to those who want the Samsung quality on smartphones but on the affordable side. The Korean tech giant decided to launch its J series this year, which is the company's latest smartphone product for the midrange segment of the market.
Identical smartphones
Just like the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, Samsung has launched the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Samsung Galaxy J5 in June, further reinforcing its reputation for simultaneously launching products that are almost similarly priced and shares the same features and specifications.
However, the Samsung Galaxy J7 is the more top-of-the-line variant between the two and reports have it that when it was launched in China in June and in India in July, it has stirred a storm in the midrange market segment.
The Galaxy J7 is larger than the Galaxy J5 with its 5.5-inch screen compared to the latter's 5-inch display screen. However, both have the same 720 x 1280-pixel resolution, notes Neurogadget.
In terms of power under the hood, the Galaxy J7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 610 chipset while the Galaxy J5 features the slightly inferior Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. The Snapdragon 610 is an octa-core processor while the Snapdragon 410 is only quad-core.
The smartphones also have similar cameras. Both smartphones feature a 13-megapixel rear-facing camera that comes with a range of functionalities including face detection, autofocus and LED flash.
In terms of memory, both the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 feature internal memory and an external memory card. While the high-end variants of the Samsung smartphones have started doing away with the external memory card support altogether, but the same features have been maintained with both midrange handsets.
The Galaxy J5 is also lighter than the Galaxy J7 as it weighs only 145 grams compared to the latter which weighs 171 grams. The weight difference is attributed basically to the battery that each device is using or has used in the past.
Impressive as it is affordable
NDTV Gadgets describes the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 as affordable smartphones with impressive specifications and features.
When the two midrange handsets came out in the Indian retail market, the Samsung Galaxy J7 came with a retail price of $230.45 while the Samsung Galaxy J5 is worth $184.36.
Both the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Samsung Galaxy J5 are being positioned by the Korean tech giant as an affordable device for gamers as the devices can potentially deliver smooth online gaming experience using 4G LTE connectivity.
Samsung has partnered with Airtel 4G so that both the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 would receive double Airtel 4G LTE data along with unlimited music downloads through the Wynk Music app.

"29",29,"South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics just released two new smartphone devices, the Samsung Galaxy J5 and the Samsung Galaxy J7, to the Chinese market.
GSM Arena
Samsung Gala J1
The two new smartphones come with front-facing LED flashes accompanied by 5 mega pixel cameras. This marks the first time for Samsung to develop handsets with LED flashes on the front, according to reports.
As part of the J series, the new Samsung Galaxy J5 and Samsung Galaxy J7 are designed for selfie enthusiasts. Reports say the move comes after Samsung's recent release of another two new devices, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S and the Samsung Galaxy Tab E, in India.
Here's the difference between the new mid-range Samsung Galaxy J7 handset and Samsung's recently released Samsung Galaxy S6, in terms of the specs and features.
The new Samsung Galaxy J7 handset sports a 5.5 inch TFT display screen, which is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S6's 5.1 inch Super AMOLED display screen. The J7's display screen has a 720 x 1280 resolution and the S6's display comes with a 1440 x 2560 resolution and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3.
Both phones run on the latest Android Lollipop operating system, but while the new Galaxy J7 has only 1.5 GB worth of RAM with 16 GB internal memory storage, the Galaxy S6 has 3 GB RAM and up to 128 GB internal memory.
The new Samsung Galaxy J7 offers a larger 3000 mAh battery compared to the S6's non-removable 2550 mAh battery. The new handset comes with only 13 mega pixel rear camera and the Galaxy S6 comes with a sharper 16 mega pixel rear camera. Both phones have 5 mega pixel front-facing cameras, and the only difference is obviously the LED flash that's found on the J7.
Another new handset that's expected to be released by the South Korean tech giant is the Galaxy A8, which is expected to have a 5.9 mm thin body, according to new images. For the new Samsung Galaxy J7, it's unclear whether it will be released to other regions outside of China.

ENTRY-LEVEL SMARTPHONES , MEIZU , NEW PHONES , SAMSUNG
Samsung will launch its much awaited Galaxy J5 in India this month, followed closely by the J7, according to distributor sources.
The 5-inch Galaxy J5 will be priced around Rs 12,000, while the larger J7 will be priced closer to Rs 15,000.
As reported earlier, the J Series is the lowest priced in the new Alphabet sub-branding introduced by the Korean company recently.
The J5 (price Rs 12,000) will be placed below the E5 (price Rs 15,000), which itself is priced below the A5 (Rs 21,000).
At Rs 12,000, the Galaxy J5 will be Rs 3,000 cheaper than the E5.
However, unlike the E5, which comes with an AMOLED 720p display, the J5 will come with a normal 720p display.
According to media reports, the J5 will also be built around the Snapdragon 410 chipset, which has built in LTE support. In contrast, E5 does not have LTE despite its higher price.
The J5 will compete with Lenovo A6000 Plus, Redmi 2 and S60 .
The Galaxy J7, meanwhile, will come with Marvel PXA1936 octa-core processor, which will help the Korean company keep the price of the J7 in the Rs 15,000 range.
At 5.5 inches, the J7 is the cheaper version of the E7.
The E7, priced at around Rs 19,500, comes with an AMOLED 720p display and offers built-in LTE support. Just like in the case of J5, the J7 will come with no AMOLED display.
Still, at Rs 15,000 the Galaxy J7 will be a strong contender for those looking for an entry-level large-display LTE phone. However, the J7 will face competition from the
Meizu M1 Note , which offers 2 GB of RAM and an AMOLED display of the same resolution at Rs around 16,000. The Meizu M1 Note is also expected to be officially released in India around the same time.
At present, Samsung has launched only the Galaxy J1, with a price of Rs 7,200 in India.

ENTRY , LENOVO , MICROMAX YU , SAMSUNG
Galaxy J5
After introducing its first J series model, J1, three months ago, Samsung is about to introduce its own versions of low-cost 4G handsets - the Galaxy J5, J7 and possibly the J2, in India.
These are the phones that Samsung hopes will help it beat back competition from the likes of Lenovo A6000 Plus, Lenovo A7000, Coolpad Dazen 1 and Yu Yuphoria.
However, going by the launch, review and reception of the J1, Samsung is likely to find the going extremely hard in India.
But first, a brief introduction to the upcoming 4G line-up from the Korean giant.
At the entry level, we have the Samsung Galaxy J2. Unfortunately, other than the fact that this 4.7-inch phone will be priced in the Rs 9,000 range, we know almost nothing about it.
Will it have 4G? Possibly, given that it would be very, very tough for the company to sell the J2 without LTE at Rs 9,000 given where the market is today in India.
What we do know a fair deal about are the other two J series phones - the Galaxy J5 and the Galaxy J7.
The J5, like the E5 and the A5, will be a 5-inch phone. However, unlike the E5, the J5 will come with a non-AMOLED 720p (not full-HD) display.
It will be built on the Snapdragon 410 chipset, and will therefore have built in 4G LTE.
In terms of most other specifications, the Galaxy J5 resembles the Lenovo phone that it will be inevitably compared against - the A7000: 1.5 GB of RAM (vs 2 GB on the A6000 Plus and A7000), 5 MP camera on the front (same as A7000, but better than A6000 Plus' 2 MP shooter), and the same chipset as the A6000 Plus.
However, at market operating price of Rs 12,000/13,000, the Galaxy J5 will not simply be a more costly version of the A7000. There are key differences that the Samsung model enjoys.
The most important among those is the back camera. The J5 will come with a 13 MP camera, while both Lenovo models have 8 MP ones. The other key difference is the higher brand value that Samsung enjoys and the strong service support that India's biggest electronics brand provides.
There might be other advantages too for the J5 over the Lenovo models, but we'll get to know that only when the phone actually launches early in July. (It was earlier expected to launch in early June.)
The Galaxy J7 is essentially a slightly more powerful and bigger version of the J5. Display size is 21% higher at 5.5 inches diagonal, while the processor has been bumped up to Snapdragon 615, though there are also reports that it will be the largely-similar Marvel PXA1936 octa-core as well.
The J7 will be priced at around Rs 15,000/16,000 initially, though MRP would be higher.
WILL J SERIES WORK?
One of the lessons that Samsung doesn't seem to have learnt enough of is that Indians are unlikely to pay 60% simply to have their phone from the biggest smartphone brand.
A case in point is the J1. At about 1.5 stars out of 5, the J1 has one of the worst ratings of all phones in the price-band, if not the worst.
And the reason is not far to seek either: It's the price.
For Rs 7,200, the phone offers specifications that others like Huawei offer at a price of Rs 4,500. However, the customer reviews of J1 make for entertaining reading.
""Fire your r&d team, with ideas like this you cannot beat xiaomi/lenovo/micromax,"" suggests Saurabh Saxena helpfully under the title 'nobody cares'.
User Santosh betrays a little more emotion. ""Worst phone ever !!!! 512 mb ram???? are you kidding me?? this is 2015, with phones like Redmi 1s have delivered 1 gb for just 6999 way back in 2014!!!!!! Grow up Samsung!!!!!""
Then there's Mac, who knows exactly who the target audience for J1 would be: ""Buy this only if you have some excess money in your wallet and have absolutely no clue what to do with it.""
In fact, these are just a sample, and if you have 'excess time' on your hands, you can read the full list of outpourings here .
Now, back to the new J series. Would J5 make sense for Rs 12,000? Frankly, it's cheap by Samsung standards. But as the reviewers point out, it's not the same market anymore.
But the good thing is that models become cheaper soon after launch and we can expect some relief on the price front in coming months.
What should really worry Samsung is the fact that is it catching up with the likes of Lenovo, Xiaomi and Huawei months after they launched entry-level, 720p, 4G smartphones.

With the advent of Chinese OEMS into the Indian market the Korean giant had been struggling in the midrange and the low range sections. Their Galaxy Grand and Core devices priced round Rs 10,000 and above were no match for the devices launched by companies like Xiaomi, Oppo. While the Grand Grand 2 with Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 still retails at Rs 14,999 on e-commerce sites, the flagship Xiaomi Mi4 can be bought at Rs 14,999. Thankfully Samsung took notice of this, and here they are with the Samsung J7. But can the device match the likes of the Mi4i priced lower at Rs 12,999? Let's find out.
Build and Design:
Samsung was never a king of this category! I always felt that their sub 15K device were never up to the mark in terms of design. The worst part is we were seing the same design language in all their devices - to boring to be honest. But I was glad that Samsung finally did a change with their flagship of 2015, Galaxy S6.
Nevertheless the Samsung J7 is plain old ordinary designed phone from the company we had been seing all while. The body is made out of plastic and to be honest the quality of materials used is not great! A metal like rim running all way round the side profile of the device.
On the other hand the Mi4i comes with an above average build quality. It feels a lot more firm and well-built mainly due the polycarbonate body. I can even vouch for the fact that, this device is one of the best build device from Xiaomi- and that too with an original design. It's even marginally slimmer than the Samsung J7 by 0.1 mm.
Display:
There's some marked difference between the two devices here. The Samsung J7 is more of phablet with a 5.5inch HD Super AMOLED display whereas the Mi4i features a 5 inch IPS panel sourced from Sharp/AUO. So for those who wants a big screen device, the J7 would be an obvious choice. You may give a think regarding the Yureka Plus and the K3 Note too .
But the worst part is yet to come. Despite featuring a 5.5 inch display the J7's display is only HD i.e. 1280x720! That's reflects at a pretty low ppi(pixel per inch) looking at today's standards. The Xiaomi Mi4i on the other hand features a Full HD IPS OGS display (1920x1080) with top notch color reproduction and viewing angles. The display possess 90% NTSC color gamut, against the 85% found in most top of the end device of today.
To be perfectly honest this display (comparable to the likes of Mi Note) is better than the one found in the flagship Mi4. Plus it comes with a nifty trick down its sleeve, the 'Sunlight Display' which changes the contrast of the display according to the lighting condition of surrounding. And the best part is that it really does work quite well in a harsh sunny day!
Under the hood:
Here both the devices match each other head on head. While the Xiaomi Mi4i comes with a 2nd gen Snapdragon 615 octacore SoC (4 Cortex A53 cores at 1.7GHz and the other 4 at 1.1GHz each), the Indian version of the J7 comes with the company's own octacore Exynos 7580. The international variants of J7 would come with a Snapdragon 615 though.
The SD615 had been in the news for all wrong reasons of late and the Mi4i had a lot to contribute to the fact. The devices heated up like anything but the company had solved the issues marginally since the last few updates. But I wouldn't recommend you to go with the Mi4i if you are looking for high performance. Go with the Samsung J7 as it will be more reliable. Despite curbing the heating issues the SD615 chipset falls prey to excessive throttling, thereby lowering the performance after a half an hour of heavy usage.

But if multitasking is your priority then I would recommend you against the J7. It features a meagre 1.5GB RAM in contrast to the 2GB present in the Mi4i. The reason I mention meagre here because the Samsung TouchWiz is a RAM hungry UI by itself! Don't expect anything more than 700GB of free RAM on the J7. Mi4 usually delivers something round 900-1GB.
Camera:
Let's make this decision easy for you. Are you a 'Selfie' focused person? If so close your eyes and grab the Samsung J7! It features a 5MP front facing camera with a 120 degree wide angle lens. But do remember it has a LED flash - this is where it beats the Mi4i 5MP front snapper hands down.
Coming to the back camera, the Mi4i holds its own here. It features a 13MP f2.0 unit with a 5 element lens. The sensor used here is none other than IMX214 (found in the popular flagships like the Mi4, One Plus One, Oppo Find 7). On the other hand J7 uses a Samsung made sensor. Both devices can shoot 1080p videos at 30fps.
OS:
I am personally not fond of the TouchWiz UI and I feel many of you out there would share my views. It hogs up the RAM without providing much a functionality. Plus one gets a number of added bloatware.
The MIUI 6 on the Mi4 though is very much customisable and utilitarian. It comes with a number of useful features that most ROMs generally don't offer as of now.
Both the devices runs on Android Lollipop 5.0.1 out of the box. Futures updates are also a possibility.
Battery:
The batteries on both the devices are a close match. While the Mi4i features a 3120mah battery, the J7 carries a 3000mah unit. Personally I feel that both the device would deliver a nearly same battery life and the extra 120mah won't make a difference. You may ask me why though! It's because that SD615 still heats up (better than before though) like anything and results in hogging down the battery life. The Exynos on the other hand has a cooler hierarchy.
Verdict:
In one line - 'Samsung J7 is a spirted attempt to match up with its Chinese counterparts, but it is still not up to the mark'. The Samsung J7 do bring something new to the table though- especially the front LED flash and the Exynos 7580.

"34",34,"Samsung Galaxy J5 And Galaxy J7 Are The Next Devices To Join The Galaxy J Series
April 8, 2015 - Written By Cory McNutt
In an effort to ' reorganize ' their smartphone offerings, Samsung now has the Galaxy S series as its main flagship device and the Galaxy Note devices as their phablet flagship.  After that, they are offering a new single-letter naming convention - the higher mid-range devices are the Galaxy A3, A5 and A7 with Super AMOLED displays, a metal frame and higher resolution front-facing cameras (FFC).  Next in line, they have their mid-range smartphone, the Galaxy 'E' series range of less expensive models.  The Galaxy 'J' series will cover the lower-midrange area with 64-bit processors and 4G LTE.  If all of this sounds confusing, it was far worse before this reorganization.
The Samsung Galaxy J1 (shown above) made its debut the first part of January in India.  It has slowly spread out to the Netherlands and Germany, and more recently to the Philippines.costing about $122 USD.  Our source now gives us some exclusive information about the Galaxy J1 follow-ups - the Galaxy J5 and the Galaxy J7 and they shared as much information as they could regarding the two devices.
We know that both devices will sport a HD TFT LCD display with the Galaxy J5 coming in at 5-inches with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  Processing power comes from a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 (MSM8916) that can be clocked up to 1.4GHz.  It will pack 1.5GB of RAM with 8GB of internal storage, although it will have a microSD card slot available for expansion.  Both devices will have either a 13MP or 8MP main camera and a 5MP FFC.  The device will be powered by a 2600mAh battery, have an 8.5 mm profile and weigh in at 149 grams.  Complete with Android Lollipop and handle 4G LTE networks.
The Galaxy J7 will sport a larger 5.5-inch HD display with either a 1.2GHz or 1.5GHz octa-core Marvel PXA1936 processor with 1.5GB of RAM and 4GB/8GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot for expansion and a 3000mAh battery.  The Galaxy J7 will only be 7.9 mm thin and weigh in at 170 grams.  It will carry either the 13MP or 8MP main camera and the larger 5MP FFC for selfies and video chatting.  It too, will come with Android Lollipop out-of-the-box and be 4G LTE ready.  No pricing is available on either the Galaxy J5 or J7 as of yet.

Moto X Play, priced at Rs 18,499 for the 16GB model and Rs 19,999 for the 32GB variant, did not lag or stutter while navigating the phone's UI and launching and switching between apps during the time we spent with it.
| TOI Tech | Sep 15, 2015, 09.05 AM IST

NEW DELHI: Motorola introduced two new variants of its Moto X flagship this year. The company has introduced the mid-range variant, Moto X Play, in India making inroads into a new category. We spent some time with the Moto X Play and here are our first impressions...
At first glance, the Moto X Play reminds us of the latest Moto G, Motorola's popular budget smartphone. It has the same dual-grille design at the front with a glossy panel; however, the front and bottom bezel is relatively smaller. While the Moto X Play packs in a 5.5-inch full-HD panel, Motorola has tried to keep the screen to body ratio optimum to make it more compact. We still feel the phone isn't fit for one-hand use if you have small hands. The phone has a metal frame that extends to the back. The frame has a soft touch finish and feels nice to touch.
Moto X Play full specs
Moto X Play's 5.5-inch full-HD (1020x1920p) IPS display that offers wide viewing angles, good brightness levels and sharp text and images. However, colours are not as vivid as they're on AMOLED displays. We were not able to use the phone under direct sunlight.
The metallic volume rocker and power keys are at the right edge of the phone with the latter sporting a ribbed design. The keys are a bit narrow but offer decent tactile feedback. The 3.5mm headset jack sits at the top along with a sim card/microSD card tray while the microUSB port is at the bottom edge.
Just like the new Moto G, the Moto X Play has a curved back with the thickness ranging from 8.9mm to 10.9mm. The Moto X Play comes with changeable back covers and the default one sports a rubberized finish and a texture to enhance the grip. It's easily removable but you'll only see a sealed battery compartment after taking it off. The back also features a metallic strip that houses the 21MP camera, a dual-LED flash and the indented Motorola logo. We've seen the strip on the third-gen Moto G and it gives the phone's back a slightly fancy look.
According to Motorola, the Moto X Play sports a nano-coating that creates a water repellent barrier to help protect against moderate exposure to water, such as accidental spills, splashes, or light rain. However, it is not waterproof and not designed to be submersed in water, or exposed to pressurized water unlike the new Moto G.
The phone has a 21MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and support for full-HD video recording. The phone has a 5MP front-facing camera. In our brief use, we found that the phone's camera app was snappy while clicking photos. We'll need to spend more time with the phone to give our verdict on the camera.
In terms of software, the experience is very close to stock Android with the Moto X Play running Android 5.1 Lollipop. Motorola also includes some of its own system apps. The Gallery, Messagging and Camera apps have been customized by the company. There are some additional Motorola features including Moto Display, Assist, Help and support for gestures to activate camera and torch functions.
The Moto X Play is powered by the 1.7GHz octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM. The smartphone offers dual-sim support and support for 4G LTE (all Indian bands), 3G, NFC and Bluetooth among others. In our brief time with the phone we did not experience any lag or stutter while navigating the phone's UI and launching and switching between apps.
It comes in 16GB and 32GB storage variants with support for microSD cards. The 16GB version is priced at Rs 18,499 while the 32GB version costs Rs 19,999.

A user agent profile with the model number SM-J700F has been spotted online and it might eventually end up being another product in the Samsungs Galaxy J series. If the model number is anything to go by, the smartphone could be the Galaxy J7,  PhoneArena reports .The smartphone seems to be a mid-segment smartphone sporting a 5.5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) display, and it could be powered by a 1.5GHz Cortex A53 chipset. There is still no clarity on the other hardware specifications as Samsung user profile only reveals limited data.

"37",37,"Samsung Introduces Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 in India, Know the Specs
Jul 29, 2015
By Aditya Leave a Comment
Samsung has been a name which has been one of the biggest gainers of the Android wave.
Ever since the android phones started booming in late 2008, Samsung has capitalized on every opportunity, every chance that they have had of gaining market credibility.
The company has been quite successful as they have been releasing phones very frequently, and at various price points, making it possible for people of all income brackets to easily buy a phone of their choice.
It is because of this reason that Samsung has become the leading names when it comes to sales of android based smartphones in most major countries, including India where they hold a 24% market share.
The company has been doing well in the Asian markets at large, and had last month released the Samsung Galaxy J5 and J7 in the markets of China.
The phones have now been introduced into the Indian markets and have entered at the sub-15000 zone, which has been the sweet spot for most of the mobile phone manufacturers in India.
The phones have been entered at a price of Rs. 11,999 for the J5 and 14,999 for the J7.
According to reports from NDTV, the two new phones are also positioned by Samsung as affordable devices for gamers as they can potentially deliver smooth online gaming experiences using 4G LTE connectivity.
As of this report both the phones are flipkart exclusives.
The two new Samsung smartphones both run Android 5.1.1 but have a few differences.
The Samsung Galaxy J5 features a 5-inch Super Amoled HD display; a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410 SoC; 1.5GB of RAM; 8GB of built-in storage; a 13-megapixel rear autofocus camera; a 5-megapixel front camera, and a 2,600mAh battery.
As for the Samsung Galaxy J7, it features a 5.5-inch screen; 16GB of inbuilt storage, a 1.5GHz octa-core Exynos 7580 SoC, and a 3,000mAh battery. Both handsets' inbuilt storage can be expanded via microSD card (up to 128GB).
Interestingly enough, the China versions of the J5 and J7 are slightly different as they feature TFT screens instead of super amoled screens, while the J5 comes with 16GB of storage instead of 8GB, and the J7 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 instead of the Exynos 7580.
Samsung has again disappointed with the look and feel of the phone as it again appears that you can pretty much put a different chipset in the same body and sell it.
The phones look like every other Samsung phone, but at the price point they are quite good.
The phones will both be running Android 5.1.1. The J5 has a 2600mAh battery while the J7 comes with a 3,000mAh.

"38",38,"Samsung Preinstalled Some Games On The Galaxy J5 And J7
August 10, 2015 - Written By Diego Macias
Samsung announced the Galaxy J5 and the Galaxy J7 about two months ago, they have been available in China, India and some European countries. Even as the name suggested that these phones belonged to the low-end, their specs actually belong to mid-range devices built with plastic. The Galaxy J5 features a 5-inch HD display, a quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor with 1.5 GB. The Galaxy J7 has a larger 5.5-inch display but it keeps the resolution the same, it uses an octa core Snapdragon 615 and the amount of RAM is the same as in the smaller phone. Both include a main camera of 13 megapixels and a front-facing one of 5 megapixels. What's interesting is that they include an LED flash on the front, making them the first Samsung devices to include such a feature. This, of course, is to make selfies taken under low-light look better, which implies that the phones are targeted to a teenage audience.
The company redesigned some aspects of its software to make it lighter so it would have less impact on the resources of the phones. This included the removal of some apps that were installed by default, although they included some apps from Microsoft, supposedly to improve the productivity. Now, it has been reported that Samsung decided to include some games from Gameloft in the two aforementioned phones. These games are installed as system apps, so they can't be uninstalled, they can only be disabled if the user doesn't want to see their icons, but they would still take up some space.
This may be to entice the potential buyers of the phones, as Samsung is also offering some in-app credits valued at Rs. 3,200 (about $50). Some of the titles include Asphalt 8: Airborne, Modern Combat 5: Blackout, GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience and Six Guns: Gang Showdown, the credits are distributed among all of the titles. Of course, there could be users that would not like to have some of these titles preinstalled in their devices, especially when the internal storage starts at 8 GB on the J5 and some titles are quite heavy. It's clear that partnerships like these prevents bloatware to be installed in the devices, not to mention the apps installed by carriers .

Samsung Galaxy J7 smartphone leaked, runs on Android 5.0.2
Details about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy J7 have leaked and show that it features a 1.5GHz ARM-53 CPU and a 720p display.
Tweet
 
Information regarding an upcoming budget smartphone from Samsung, the Galaxy J7, has been leaked. The information about the Samsung Galaxy J7 was leaked via a Samsung user agent profile. This upcoming phone may be a viable competitor to other budget phones as a shipping record reveals that the phone is priced at Rs. 15,908.
The leaked data suggests that the smartphone is powered by an ARM-53 CPU which has a maximum clock speed of 1.5GHz. These specifications do match a particular SoC, which we believe is the new 64-bit Mediatek 6732. This SoC from MediaTek comprises of a quad-core CPU configuration based on ARM-53 architecture with its CPUs at clocked 1.5GHz.
The display will have a resolution of 1280 x 720p but the display size has not been revealed. Other details like RAM, storage and camera sensors are still a mystery. The device runs on Android 5.0.2 . The smartphone is under testing which was confirmed by the shipping details, which reveal that two units are already in India for testing purposes.
Samsung also revealed the Samsung Galaxy J1 earlier this year which was an entry level smartphone.

"46",46,"Samsung Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 leak reveals new mid-range smartphones
April 8, 2015
By Adam Leave a Comment
Samsung started its new naming convention last year, and since that time we've seen a number of new handsets announced under the branding. Two of the latest have just appeared in a new leak, so now we're going to get to know the Samsung Galaxy J5 and Samsung Galaxy J7.
Samsung's new naming scheme comes in tiers, and the ""J series"" is towards the bottom when it comes to specs while the A series it towards the top. The Samsung Galaxy J1 was made official earlier this year, and the Samsung Galaxy J5 and J7 look to follow in its midrange footsteps.
First up is the Samsung Galaxy J5 which carries the model number SM-J500F. The smartphone sports a 5-inch 720p display with one of the new 64-bit Snapdragon 410's and 1.5GB of RAM. The storage capacity is listed at 8GB, but is expandable and it will sip its power from a 2,600mAh battery. The J5 is 8.5mm thin with a weight of 149grams, and will run Android 5.0 out of the box.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 is similar to its sibling, but has a larger 5.5-inch display, and the option of 4GB or 8GB of storage. That option extends to the processor as well, as there will be a 1.2GHz or 1.5GHz octa-core Marvel PXA1936 chip under the hood. The battery is listed at 3,000mAh, but everything else essentially stays the same. Both handsets will come with a 13MP/5MP camera combo and 4G LTE, but there is a possibility that 13MP snapper will be swapped out for an 8MP one before primetime.
Samsung's new smartphones could be popular if they can keep the price down. The company knows they have to change things up to compete in the midrange market against the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and others, and the Samsung Galaxy J5 along with the Samsung Galaxy J7 and J1 may be their way of doing just that.
Would you like to see the Samsung Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 come to your region if priced right?

"58",58,"Samsung Galaxy J7 in India con Exynos 7580 al posto di S615
17 Luglio 2015 11
Scheda Tecnica
Nella giornata di ieri, Samsung ha ufficializzato i due nuovi device della serie J, Galaxy J5 e Galaxy J7 , anche in India, a distanza di circa un mese dalla Cina . Si è scoperto che il più largo Galaxy J7 monta un SoC diverso da quello della variante cinese, un Exynos 7580 al posto dello Snapdragon 615 di Qualcomm.
A livello tecnico i due chip non differiscono moltissimo: entrambi sono octa-core, e sfruttano l'architettura Cortex-A53 di ARM. La GPU è invece diversa, naturalmente: Adreno 405 per Qualcomm, ARM Mali-T720 MP2 per Exynos.
Nonostante la somiglianza, abbiamo avuto modo di vedere nei benchmark di Galaxy S5 Neo come la soluzione di Samsung riesca a battere agevolmente Qualcomm sia nei test single-core che in quelli multi-core | I primi benchmark di Galaxy S5 Neo mostrano risultati interessanti per Exynos 7580 |. C'è da dire che i benchmark facevano riferimento a un processore con clock di 1.60 GHz, mentre nel caso di Galaxy J7 ci si ferma a 1.5 GHz.
Difficile stabilire quale versione arriverà in Europa, anche se visti i precedenti è più facile ipotizzare quella con Snapdragon. Il resto delle caratteristiche è invariato.

"62",62,"Smartphone war: Samsung to launch 10 devices in the next quarter in Rs 9,000-18,000 segment
Writankar Mukherjee, ET Bureau Jun 25, 2015, 10.36AM IST
(Samsung Electronics Company.)
KOLKATA: Samsung Electronics Company, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, is planning its biggest blitzkrieg of launches in India in the next quarter in a bid to fend off local and Chinese rivals in the mid-segment category.
The South Korean company will introduce 10 smartphones in the July-September quarter in theRs 9,000 to Rs 18,000 segment, where it is embroiled in a fierce battle for market share with Micromax Informatics, Lenovo-Motorola and Xiaomi. According to some research companies, the rivalry led to a drop in Samsung's market share in the high-stakes mid-segment in 2014.
Over the past few quarters, Samsung has launched mostly variants of older models such as Galaxy Grand and Galaxy Core in this segment, which have failed to stand up to competition. The new strategy is championed by Samsung India president HyunChil Hong, who took over in December. Smartphones account for 70% of the company's revenue in India.
This will be Samsung's largest rollout of unique models in India, according to three senior trade executives, who have been informed about the latest move by company officials and distributors.
""We do not comment on market speculation,"" a Samsung India spokesperson said in response to an email sent by ET. ""However, Samsung is committed to the Indian market and will continue to cater to the needs of consumers with innovative products and technology.""
Most of the new models will be introduced under a sub-brand called the J series and the 4G-compliant handsets will be made in India. Two models, Galaxy J7 and J5, are expected to be the first to hit store shelves early next month.
""After beating Apple in the premium smartphone segment last quarter, Samsung is now looking at extending its lead in the overall market by filling the gap with a new line-up in the Rs 9,000-18,000 segment and would spend hugely on promotions,"" the CEO of a leading electronics retail chain said, asking not to be identified.
The Korean giant will also launch its next flagship model, the Galaxy Note 5, in India in September, ahead of Apple's traditional iPhone launch and in time for the festive season.
The mid-segment accounts for 30% of smartphone sales by volume in India and is second only to the entry-level category, which has 35% of sales, according to Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Technology Market Research. TheRs 9,000-18,000 segment is the fastest growing and expected to become the largest in the next two quarters.
Samsung has strongly contested data by market trackers Canalys, based in the UK, and CMR India, which show that the Korean company lost ground in this category to Gurgaon-based Micromax.
Samsung's share in the Indian smartphone market fell from 43.2% to 23.7% in 2014 as Micromax, Karbonn and Intex gained, according to CMR India data. However, in the January-March quarter, Samsung bounced back with a 27.9% share after boosting its presence in the entry and premium segments, while Micromax was second with 16.2%, CMR India said. Analysts and retailers said the two smartphone makers are in close competition with each other and Chinese brands.
Samsung positions its smartphones more on overall experience, while its Indian and Chinese rivals highlight features such as 4G connectivity, battery capacity and screen resolution to grab the attention of consumers, according to Tarun Pathak, a senior analyst at Counterpoint. ""Chinese and Indian brands have a faster time to market than Samsung, which allows them to adapt faster.
However, Samsung still has one of the most robust distribution reaches in India compared to any other vendor, but it needs to have a faster time to market along with aggressive presence in online channels, which it seems to be doing now,"" Pathak said.

Samsung has launched the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 in June as a bold attempt of the Korean tech giant to regain its market share in the mid-range smartphone market that it once held firmly well.
Just like its grasp on the high-end smartphone market not too long ago, Samsung eventually lost it with its own doing when it released the Samsung Galaxy S5 in March last year with hardly any major improvement from its high-end flagship smartphone of 2013, the Samsung Galaxy S4.
As a result, the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus swallowed the Samsung Galaxy S5 in whole not to mention a significant portion of the Korean tech giant's high-end smartphone market share.
But Samsung bounced back this year big time with the launching of the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge to redeem itself and eventually recover lost ground, and more importantly, its market share in the high-end smartphone market.
The Korean tech giant did great in making that huge turnaround with the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge. Three months later, Samsung wanted to do the same in the mid-range smartphone market, thus launching the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5.
Same bland design
While Samsung has promised a complete makeover of its entire smartphone lineup this year, the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 actually came out with the same bland designs of the previous Samsung mid-range handsets.
Compared for example with the Huawei P8lite, the Galaxy S7 actually struggles to even deserve a second look, notes Neurogadget.
The Chinese smartphone maker has obviously come out with a beautiful-looking smartphone for the mid-range market, which many critics believe as the hands down title contender for the best designed mid-range smartphone of 2015.
What the Samsung Galaxy J7 lack in design and aesthetics, however, it actually made up for it with features that the Korean tech giant has been known to deliver on its mobile devices.
Both the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 look more like every other Galaxy smartphones in the market. They both feature anodized bodies, shiny, cheap-looking faux-metal side bezels, and the same monotonous overall design profile.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 actually looks a lot like the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 launched in 2013, whose problem then was being too slippery to grasp on the hands.
A response to the mid-range smartphone leaders
The Samsung Galaxy J5 and the Samsung Galaxy J7 actually signal the Korean tech giant's response to the heavy hitters in the global mid-range handset currently dominated by Motorola, Sony, Xiaomi, among other players.
Although it is affordably priced just like the other mid-range smartphones including the Xiaomi Mi 4i, the Motorola Moto G 2nd Generation, the Sony Xperia E 4G, among several others, Samsung has evidently raised the bar in the market with the superb specifications and features of its Galaxy J series smartphones, notes NDTV Gadgets.
The mid-range smartphones both run on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box and both came out on its home market in South Korea followed by its biggest market in China, before making it to India in July and other Asian markets.
Just like the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, Samsung launched the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Samsung Galaxy J5 to validate its reputation for simultaneously launching products that are almost similarly priced and carry almost the same features.
However, the Samsung Galaxy J7 is the more top-of-the-line variant between the two and reports have it that when it was launched in China in June and in India in July, it has stirred a storm in the midrange market segment.
The Galaxy J7 is larger than the Galaxy J5 with its 5.5-inch screen compared to the latter's 5-inch display screen. However, both have the same 720 x 1280-pixel resolution
In terms of power under the hood, the Galaxy J7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 610 chipset while the Galaxy J5 features the slightly inferior Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. The Snapdragon 610 is an octa-core processor while the Snapdragon 410 is only quad-core.

"69",69,"South Korean company Samsung Electronics and Japanese company Sony Corporation just released two new selfie-focused smartphones, the mid-range Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Sony Xperia C4 respectively, this month.
Sony Mobile
The new Samsung Galaxy J7 smartphone was released alongside another model, the Samsung Galaxy J5, in the Chinese market. Sony, on the other hand, had begun releasing the new Sony Xperia C4 smartphone in Asia, according to a recent announcement, and is planning to launch the new device afterwards to other markets as well.
Both phones come with 5 mega pixel front-facing cameras accompanied by LED flashes and powerful 13 mega pixel cameras on the back. The cameras for the new phones are also said to come with panorama, face detection and touch focus capabilities.
Both phones also come with 5.5 inch display screens, but while the Sony Xperia C4 comes with a scratch resistant IPS LCD screen with a 1080 x 1920 resolution, the new Samsung Galaxy J7 has a TFT screen with a 720 x 1280 resolution.
Internally, the Samsung Galaxy J7 packs a 1.5 GB RAM and 16 GB internal memory storage, and the Sony Xperia C4 has 2 GB RAM and 16 GB internal memory as well.

Both the internal memory of the new handsets can be expanded up to 128 GB via microSD card. The new Xperia C4 is powered by a non-removable 2600 mAh battery, and the new Galaxy comes with a bigger 3000 mAh battery.

Huawei P8, P8 Lite to take on Samsung Galaxy A7, A8 & J7
In an attempt to move up the value chain, Huawei will introduce its latest phones in India - the high-end P series comprising the P8 and the P8lite.
HUAWEI P8 Price Rs 26k
The most interesting of all the phones is the Huawei P8 and the P8 Lite. The P8 actually has two versions - a low end and a high-end version. According to our sources, it is possible that only the lower speced version will be launched in India initially.
The Huawei P8 is the Chinese company's attempt to move into the premium market and not just focus on the entry-level segment.
However, the P8 is not a true flagship like, for example, the Sony Z sereis or the Samsung S series is. In many ways, the P8 can be compared to Huawei's own Honor 6 Plus because of its full-HD display (as opposed to a quad-HD display.)
However, unlike the Huawei Honor 6 Plus, the P8 has a 5.2 inch display.
It is powered by Huawei's in-house Kirin 630 processor, which is still being manufactured on the 28 nm process. The Kirin 640 will move to the 16 nm FinFet technology.
As mentioned earlier, there are two versions of the phone - one with 16 GB memory and another with 64 GB memory. It is not clear which one is being launched in India. Given the price, it could be either.
One of the interesting things about the phone is the front camera. Unlike other models, the P8 comes with an 8 MP shooter in the front and a 13 MP camera at the back.
Everything else, including 3 GB of RAM and 4G LTE support, are standard flagship specifications. Battery, at 2.7 Ah, is not the biggest we have seen though.
HUAWEI P8Lite Price Rs 14k
Together with the above model, Huawei will also launch the 'Lite' version of the phone, priced considerably lower. This one will come with a 720p, 5-inch display and a slower Kirin 620 processor. While the back camera remains the same on P8Lite, the front camera has been reduced to a 5 MP unit. Battery will be 2.2 Ah.
Storage memory will be 16 GB.
OUR TAKE
We believe Indian buyers may not accept 'premium' pricing from Huawei, even if the quality of the handsets are well above those of its entry-level offerings. As a result, much will depend on the actual market pricing.

Samsung Galaxy J7: annunciato in India con CPU Exynos 7580
Giovanni D'Alo' 20/07/2015 Lascia un commento 16 Visualizzazioni
Samsung Galaxy J7 nelle scorse ore è stato ufficialmente annunciato sul territorio Indiano con processore Exynos 7580
Il Samsung Galaxy J7 è stato annunciato anche sul territorio indiano nelle scorse ore a 30 giorni esatti dall'annunciato in Cina.
Entrando nello specifico, per il Galaxy J7 del colosso sud-coreano c'è stato un cambiamento hardware non indifferente, al posto di montare il Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 è stato adottata la CPU proprietaria Exynos 7580.
I due processori appena citati sono uguali, infatti per quanto riguarda Exynos 7580 è sempre un octa-core con ARM Cortex-A53.
Il cambiamento vero e proprio consiste nella GPU, per lo Snapdragon 615 abbiamo Adreno 405 mentre per il soc proprietario di Samsung Mali-T720 MP2.
Quando arriverà il Samsung Galaxy J7 in Europa?
Attualmente non sappiamo se il Samsung Galaxy J7 verrà rilasciato anche in Europa e soprattutto sul territorio Italiano. Vi faremo sapere al più presto.

Samsung Galaxy Note Edge
Samsung continues its onslaught in the Android market as it is tipped to release another midrange device that is probably aimed at the mass market in China.
In fact, in recent reports, the upcoming Samsung Galaxy J7 has been leaked in both the TENAA in China, and the Bluetooth SIG.
According to a recent report by GSM Arena, the device has also been seen in a retailer in Kazakhstan. In the report, the device will reportedly cost KZT 49,990, which is about $268 or 241 euros.
Other specs of the Galaxy J7, according to previous listings and leaks include a 5.5-inch display with HD (1280 x 720) resolution, a 1.5GB RAM, a Marvell's PXA1936 chipset, an octa-core CPU clocked 1.2GHz or 1.4GHz. That means the device will come in two versions, at least in the Kazakhstan retailer listing.
Moreover, there is a 13MP primary camera, a 5MP front shooter, 16GB of built-in memory, and Android 5.0.2 Lollipop out of the box.
Based on the retailer's listing, the device will ship in August.
Samsung will definitely become busy in the coming months as it prepares for the successor of the Galaxy Alpha, as well as the Galaxy Note 5 and Note 5 Edge. However, it will still remain a mystery whether the Korean manufacturer will finally use a Qualcomm chipset for its flagship devices, or stick with the Exynos SoCs.

Owners of the Samsung Galaxy J7 and a few other mid-range devices from the company will no longer have to resort to custom ROMs in order to get Android 5.1.1, as Samsung have started deploying the update officially. Currently, the release is limited to India, but it's reported to be coming to the US pretty soon, so those who've been waiting to get the benefits of 5.1.1 will not have to wait much longer.
More specifically, the update is targeted for the Galaxy J7 and Galaxy J5, both of which have been enjoying a lot of popularity in their respective market segment. Samsung have been paying a lot of attention to their flagships, but also to the lower brackets of their market, so we can expect even more activity on that front in the future.
Reports indicate that the update actually works quite well on the devices and it should bring some significant improvements to the use experience of their owners. Most notably, the battery life seems to have gotten a pretty big increase as a result of some optimizations in the operating system, and some experts have been testing the new performance in detail, claiming that the device is practically idle during the night in terms of battery usage.
The situation about the J1 seems a bit unclear at the moment, and even though the device is also rumored to be getting the update through the official OTA channel, we don't know when that might happen. However, there are already custom ROMs available for it which bring it up to Android 5.1.1 Lollipop, and the installation procedure is pretty standard.
Users who've flashed an Android device previously will not have to worry about anything as long as they take the necessary precautions, and of course the most important thing is to make a full backup to prevent the loss of data. In addition, flashing a custom ROM might pose some risks with regards to post-purchase support, but Android is generally more relaxed in this regard and users shouldn't worry too much.
Rooting the device also brings various benefits to the user that are not normally available with a regular phone with the stock operating system. It generally makes the experience more free and unrestricted, especially for users who like to play with special apps and get the most from their device.
In fact, some users have decided to completely skip the official update channels in favor of custom ROMs like CyanogenMOD, which offer various improvements to the operating system and make it much more stable, lightweight and even more secure than the stock Android. The knowledge barrier for flashing a custom ROM to a device has been getting lower and lower too, with detailed guides all over the Internet explaining how to root a device and how to deploy the relevant version of Android to it. It's a relatively safe procedure at this point without any of the risks that it carried before.
It's interesting to note that Samsung seem to be paying more and more attention to their mid-range devices lately, unlike before when they were almost exclusively focused on flagships. The company seems to be realizing the importance of covering the market evenly instead of concentrating on one area of their operations, and they might end up retaining their position as one of the biggest players on the smartphone market if they continue this attitude.

"75",75,"Samsung Introducing New Smartphones For India
July 8, 2015 - Written By David Steele
India is a market that the world's smartphone manufacturers cannot ignore. It is currently one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world and is set to overtake the United States of America in smartphones sales by 2017. This strong growth, which showed an increase of 21% in the first quarter of 2015 compared with Q1 2014, is underpinned by India's developing economy and strong increase in the number of online users. The smartphone is a simple and highly portable way to get online, requiring relatively little in terms of infrastructure compared with fixed line broadband. The potential of the Indian market is not being ignored by domestic companies and there are several producing devices for the local market. As such, the Indian market has evolved quickly leaving many of the international smartphone manufacturers struggling to keep up. The bigger selling devices are the lower priced, entry level to mid range devices: four out of every five smartphones sold belongs in these camps. It's here we are seeing many new models, some with innovative and stand-out features, most recently in the battery capacity department . However, Samsung has maintained the top spot in the market since it first started selling smartphones. In Q1 2015, it had almost 26% of the market, outperforming second place Indian manufacturer, Micromax, which managed a little under 20%.
Samsung, however, are not resting on their laurels. Their low and mid-range device face stiff competition from local (Indian) manufacturers plus a myriad of Chinese companies, many of which are investing in Indian manufacturing plants driven by the Indian government's ""Make in India"" campaign. This has certainly helped Samsung as their third largest smartphone factory is based in India. We have also seen plans from Samsung to build another factory in the region with an investment of $100 million, although it will manufacture the flagship Galaxy S6 family of devices. Samsung is consolidating its position as the number one in the market by introducing a number of new lower to mid range models, specifically in the J-series. We are expecting the Galaxy J2, Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 to be introduced in September. These smartphones will go head to head with low cost, high specification competitor models such as the Xiaomi Redmi 2, Lenovo A7000 and YU Yuphoria.
It will be interesting to see how the Galaxy J models line up compared with the other lower and mid-range models in the Samsung portfolio, these being the Galaxy A and Galaxy E devices. The J series are currently sold for prices ranging from around $90 up to approximately $220 and are the cheapest LTE-equipped devices in the Samsung portfolio. We have also seen Samsung experimenting with other devices, such as the first Tizen OS handset, the Z1, which was introduced in January. With new production facilities boosting the existing plant, a range of new devices and a willingness to experiment, Samsung appears to have all of the tools it needs to compete with the competition. And with the Indian smartphone market being so significant, the stakes are potentially high.

"78",78,"Unannounced Samsung Galaxy J7's specs confirmed through retail website
Posted:
Categories: Samsung , Android
The Galaxy J7 still hasn't been announced by Samsung, but there's more than enough evidence to suggest that it, along with the Galaxy J5, will be arriving very soon. Any shred of doubt about the existence of the J7 has just been all-but quashed with a leak of the handset's tech. specs, which have just popped up on the site of a Russian retailer. Moreover, the Galaxy J7 is also up for pre-order through said website, which can surely only mean that Samsung will be coming through with an announcement imminently. 
By the look of the spec. sheet, which you can see at the foot of this article, the device is unashamedly mid-range, with its 5.5-inch display chucking out a modest 720 x 1280 resolution. Sure, it's still, strictly speaking, an HD panel, but it's not going to dazzle anybody, and given the phablet-sized canvas, those picking up the J7 will notice the pixels. With so many average handsets bundling a 1080p display these days, even those shopping on a tight budget might swerve the J7 and the 5-inch J5 , the latter of which will almost certainly follow suit with a 720p display.
There's an octa-core Marvel PXA1936 processor under the hood, which is accompanied by 1.5 gigs of RAM. Storage-wise, the J7 adds 16 GB natively, and those who like to hoard apps, games and other media content will be pleased to learn that there's a microSD slot in tow. Completing the vital stats, the J7 includes a very workable 3000 mAh battery, and the version listed on the Russian website mentions dual-SIM support. Whether a single-SIM version is planned for the likes of the U.S. and other parts of the world remains to be seen, but all will hopefully be clarified by an official unveiling in the near future.
We learned earlier this week that the J7 and J5 will include the same TouchWiz UX as the Galaxy S6 and S6 plus, but aside from also being handsets made by Samsung, there are precious few similarities between the new J models and the much-vaunted S6 duo. 
We'll keep an eye out for the details on pricing and availability should they emerge, but hopefully, such info will be outed by Samsung when it decides to put an end to the speculation.

September 17, 2015
By Debbie Turner Leave a Comment
Two Samsung smartphones that arrived this summer were the Galaxy J7 and Galaxy J5.  The first of these is the most expensive of the two but they are both mid-sector handsets that have more affordable price tags than flagship devices.  If you're trying to choose between them you might appreciate a video comparison showing the Samsung Galaxy J7 vs Galaxy J5 in a mid-range battle.
Back in July we published a specs comparison of the Samsung Galaxy J7 vs Galaxy J5 and you can check that out at the link for full specs and more.   Sometimes though, it can be useful to take a closer video look at two devices before making a choice between them and that's why we're showing a YouTube video from XEETECHCARE.
Although there are some similar specs there are also some important differences and those are made clear in the comparison.  We've positioned the video below this story and it will enable you to see both devices side-by-side so that you can get an idea of the size difference.  It goes on to discuss the design and build of the phones and shows a tour around the handsets.
The comparison also covers the software experience of the phones, processors and performance, storage, camera capabilities, pricing and more.  At the conclusion of the video the reviewer notes that battery life on both handsets is among the best he's ever seen for a mid-range Samsung phone.  The video offers a handy look at both devices and hopefully will help you to decide which would suit your needs and your budget best.
After watching the Samsung Galaxy J7 vs Galaxy J5 video below we'd appreciate your thoughts.  Are you going to opt for the Galaxy J7 or Galaxy J5 smartphone?  Do let us know by sending us your comments.

Galaxy Note 5 first look: What's new in Samsung's latest phablet
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is so far the thinnest Note phablet we have seen. Here's a quick look at what is new in this smartphone.
Written by Shruti Dhapola | New Delhi |
Updated: September 8, 2015 2:41 pm
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has been launched in India at a price of Rs 53,900.
Samsung Galaxy Note 5 is now available in India at a starting price of Rs 53,900 for the 32GB model and Rs 59,900 for the 64GB model. The Galaxy Note 5 goes on sale in India on September 20 and comes with support for wireless charging. Samsung has not clubbed the wireless charger with the device, but users who pre-book the phone before September 19 will get it for free.
We take a look at what's new in the Galaxy Note 5 from Samsung.
Screen, Design: The new Galaxy Note features a 5.7-inch Quad HD Super AMOLED display with a pixel density of 518ppi. Samsung has kept the screen size and resolution the same as the Galaxy Note 4, which also had a 5.7-inch screen. But with the Note 5, Samsung has ditched the faux-leather back cover design we saw in the previous

Galaxy Note 5's biggest change is the design where Samsung has gone with full metal and glass look as it has done with the Samsung S6, S6 edge and S6 edge+ series. The new Galaxy Note comes in Black Sapphire, Gold Platinum and Silver Titan colour variants, which is again more in tune with the Galaxy S6 colour scheme.
Samsung has ditched the colourful pink version we saw in the Note 4 as well. At 7.6mm thin, the Note 5 is also thinner than the previous versions of the device. The Galaxy Note 4 was 8.5mm thick.

In terms of design, the glass and metal body of the Samsung  Galaxy Note 5 is more prone to smudges and also quite slippery as we saw in the demo zone, during the launch event.
Processor, RAM, Storage The Galaxy Note 5 comes with octa-core Exynos 7420 processor with 4GB of LPDDR4 RAM and comes in 32GB and 64GB versions. Samsung says this Galaxy Note 5 is 4G LTE Cat 6 ready for India as well. In the 32GB version, around 24 GB space is available for the users.

The processor is a change from earlier version of the Note in India, which was launched with Snapdragon processor. The Galaxy Note 4 came with Snapdragon 805 2.7 GHz quad-core processor coupled with 3GB RAM and 32 GB internal storage space.
Camera, Connectivity: On the camera front, Note 5 houses a 16MP OIS f1.9 rear camera along with a 5MP f1.9 front snapper. It comes with Bluetooth 4.2, Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, GPS/ A-GPS, and Micro-USB 2.0. Only the front camera had gotten a bump in the new Note 5.
Galaxy Note 5 comes with a 3000 mAh battery. (Source: Shruti Dhapola)
Battery: Samsung Galaxy Note 5's other big hardware change is the end of the removable battery and expandable storage options. The battery in the Galaxy Note 5 is 3,000 mAh, which has raised concerns that it won't be enough. Samsung however says that they have wireless charging and quick charging technology and an Ultra-power saving mode, which will boost the battery life.

S-Pen: Samsung has also improved the S-Pen, which is a key feature in the productivity aspect of the Note 5.  The new S-Pen now has a one-click eject mechanism, with an improved 'Air Command' feature as well.

For this kind of price range, you can expect good specs that perform well that also looks good, and probably a smartphone that can last you for at least a year before your next upgrade. We shall see whether Samsung Galaxy J7 and Micromax Canvas Sliver 5 would fit in that category or not.
- Advertisement - 
With customers becoming more conscious and weary on how they spend their hard-earned money, it is becoming a war zone out there among all the smartphone manufacturers as the market becomes more and more competitive by the day. Is spending $300 on a smartphone justified? Or will it be a flop in the market with really low take up?
We already have Samsung with its recently introduced flagship A-series that is making huge success in the market with its stylish metal outlook. This time around, the J-series is meant to be its mid-range offerings to the market. That is exactly where Samsung's strength is, they have a smartphone for just about everyone. With a body measuring 152.2 x 79.1 x 7.9 mm (5.99 x 3.11 x 0.31 in) and weighing 169 g (5.96 oz), it sure is having a slim profile. Too bad it does not have a metal body to complement its slimness.
Talk about slim and light, the Canvas Sliver 5 fares much better. Featuring a razor-thin 5.1mm body, the Canvas Sliver 5 is a design and engineering marvel. Carved to perfection, the phone has been sculpted aesthetically for the perfect fit in the palm of your hands. Weighing in at just 97 grams, it is the first 4G LTE phone that is below 100 grams. What an achievement and congrats to Micromax for achieving such great feat.
How did it manage to achieve all that? This is because the Canvas Sliver 5 is crafted from aircraft-grade aluminum, which is robust as well as light. This also makes for a strong and durable device. The precision craftsmanship and its automatic polishing makes for a delicate finish.
Now we shall move on to the screen aspect of things. The Galaxy J7 is sporting a 5.5-inch High Definition TFT capacitive touchscreen of 720 x 1280 pixels or ~267 ppi pixel density which makes for a decent screen. In this day and age, it is a huge wonder why on earth are they still using TFT when others have been making full use of the IPS technology. Cost-saving maybe, but it certainly doesn't help its case - especially not in this price range.
As for the Canvas Sliver 5, it is sporting a 4.8-inch High Definition AMOLED capacitive touchscreen with a display of 720 x 1280 pixels or ~306 ppi pixel density, this makes for a rather good viewing whether it is reading your favorite e-book, browsing through your social media or watching those Youtube videos. Your investment is even protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3 which is even better. It also integrates its touch response layer into the display itself using 'Oncell' technology thus making it slimmer.
Yes, the Galaxy J7 does have a larger screen but the technology and protection that the Canvas Sliver 5 brings to the table makes it a much better proposition in just about anything.
Let's now check out on the performance side of things. Under the hood of the Galaxy, J7 is the Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics, and 1.5GB RAM. That's another odd thing that Samsung decided to go for just 1.5GB memory and not have 2GB like others in this mid-range space.
But it sure is a lot better than the Canvas Sliver 5. We have over here the Qualcomm MSM8916 Snapdragon 410 chipset, a Quad-core 1.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, Adreno 306 graphics and 2GB RAM. This makes for a very decent performance that should have no trouble running all your favorite apps and games.
Even though the Canvas Sliver 5 has more memory, the Galaxy J7 has a better chipset, twice the amount of cores and better graphics that makes it a winner. If only it were to have 2GB memory instead, that would have been just nice.
- Advertisement - 
Camera-wise, the Galaxy J7 has the 13MP-5MP setup that is quite average for others in this price range. To ensure that it stays above the rest, that's where it has a secondary camera that also comes with its flash that ensures a better selfie picture even under low light conditions.
Compare that to the Canvas Sliver 5 which has a 8MP-5MP combo but its primary camera is packed with SONY IMX219 sensor, 4P Largan lens and Blue Glass Filter. It makes for a rather wide 75.6 degrees angle, so you are able to capture more in a single shot. You should be able to make the most of the built-in camera modes to capture life in all its stunning glory. There is a professional mode, night shot, and horizontal panorama shot. Then there's the 5MP secondary camera that makes the package complete.
By taking lots and lots of pictures, you're going to need a good amount of storage right? Both the Galaxy J7 and Canvas Sliver 5 has 16GB of internal storage that is nice. While the Galaxy J7 has a microSD slot that allows for an additional 128GB, the Canvas Sliver 5 doesn't have any. So if you require more space, you have to turn to cloud storage it seems. Guess it has to do with keeping up its slim and lightweight profile.
Something really unexpected from Samsung is that, the Galaxy J7 will be having the latest Android Lollipop 5.1 right out of the box that is a great thing since you won't have to wait for any updates from Samsung. We know how well Samsung takes care of its flagship devices, but to have a similar treatment for a mid-range device; not that's something new. Keep it up guys!
The Canvas Sliver 5 will also be Android Lollipop although it is slightly dated @ version 5.0. But the performance gain and bug fixes should have improved performance on both devices quite considerably.
Battery-wise, the Galaxy J7 is miles ahead with its Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery, which is considerably good for its size and power. Expect it to be able to last you for at least a day in between charging.
As for the Canvas Sliver 5, it is powered by a rather limited Li-Po 2000 mAh battery that might even struggle to last for a day, particularly if you are a heavy user. Guess you have no choice but to have a power bank on standby just in case you need it.
There's one more thing that we need to highlight which is something good to have especially if you are an audio freak. You can now enjoy crystal clear tones and a deep resounding bass on the Canvas Sliver 5. It is equipped with NXP Smart Power Amplifier and Dirac HD sound. Enjoy rich sound tonality with deeper bass range as there is more output volume without damaging the speakers. With Dirac HD Sound, it is all about delivering amazing surround sound, sound correction as opposed to sound effects as well as an advanced algorithm which creates a tailored digital controller.
Finally, both smartphones have 4G LTE connectivity but only the Galaxy J7 has dual sim capability.

The Samsung Galaxy J7 is at best average if the price indication is anything to go by. But pit it against the Canvas Sliver 5, and it is a totally different thing altogether.
Being the world's lightest 4G LTE smartphone with a very slim profile to boot, the Micromax Canvas Sliver 5 will certainly make people drooling for it. You will also be getting a pretty decent performer and camera as well. The only downside is its rather limited storage and small battery which can be negated if you turn on cloud storage or carry a powerbank with you.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 is expected to be released in next month and will be available for approximately $290 USD. It will be available in black, white and gold.
The Micromax Canvas Sliver 5 is readily available for $279 USD and is only available in white.

For years, there have been accusations that Samsung has been selling phones with lesser specs for higher price. This saw it being overshadowed by the likes of Micromax, Xiaomi and OnePlus.
After some botched efforts with its online exclusive models, the Korean giant is back in the business with J7 and J5 4G-enabled smartphones. J5 is priced at Rs. 11,999, while J7 a bit costlier with a price tag of Rs. 14,999
At the onset the company is offering a superior specifications compared to its higher-priced mid-ranged smartphones exclusively on Flipkart.
One of the highlights of both the devices is the 5MP front facing camera LED flash, which is aimed at the selfie lovers.
Galaxy J5 features 8GB of storage and houses a 5-inch 720p HD display, and runs on the combination of a 1.2GHz quad core Snapdragon 410 processor and 1.5GB of RAM. A 2600mAh battery and a 13MP camera are two of its other important attributes.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 on the other hand goes for a 5.5-inch 720p display. It possesses a 1.5GHz octa core Exynos 7580 CPU, apart from 1.5GB of RAM. There's 16GB of storage onboard as well, apart from a 13MP camera and a 3000mAh battery.
The sales numbers of these phones will also have an impact on the online strategy of Samsung. Despite being the highest selling smartphone in India, it has struggled when it comes to online sales.
Samsung is also wooing users with a lot of freebies. While there will be free in game credits worth Rs 3200 for top titles, Airtel is giving buyers a double data offer as well as access to music worth Rs 594 over six months.
It looks like Samsung will continue to struggle as Lenovo, Xiaomi and Motorola offer smartphones with superior specifications in the same price ranges. There are a few newcomers like InFocus who have recently entered the market and the Korean giant will face some stiff resistance.

New information has surfaced about an approaching Samsung apparatus - the Galaxy J7. It is one of the budget-friendly device from the company's new Galaxy J line up. The company has launched Galaxy J1 in February, and it should be the next phone in the line-up.
The info comes from a leaked UA profile from the database of Samsung. According to it, the upcoming phone, bearing the version SM J700F, will pack power-efficient Cortex A53 cores with 1.5 GHz processor. The Galaxy J7 will feature a display with resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels and judging by Samsung's recent naming convention the 7 likely signifies a display size of 5.5-inches, just like the Galaxy E7 and A7 .
There's no further information regarding the handset's storage, camera, RAM and other features, but as per the tracking records from zauba.com, the sample units happen to be on their way to India for testing, therefore it will not be too long before we get some more info on the alleged Galaxy J7.

Since its India launch this May, Internet.org had come in for criticism for being a ""walled garden"" for its limited number of partners and single service provider. Daniels said the Free Basics was now open to all developers and there was no intention of putting a filter on it. ""Also, there is no exclusivity with Reliance in India. There are other telecom operators who are interested, but it seems the criticism has slowed down the conversation. Reliance is just our first partner in India and there are countries where we have multiple partners,"" he clarified.
Daniels said Facebook does not pay service providers for the data and ""no money changes hands"". ""The commercial benefit for service providers is that people move on to paid services soon,"" he added, adding that the platform was open for competing brands or organisations to come on board. On reports that Facebook was the most used service on Internet.org, Daniels said it was only natural that the social networking service's popularity would reflect even in this platform.
Among the new features in the FreeBasics app is the option for users on the app or the mobile web version to add the services which they want to add to their list of free services from the list of 250 plus partners. Moreover, the mobile web version will also support the secure HTTPS services from now on. Facebook has also put out the privacy language ""so that people will know what data will be collected"".
Ime Archibong, director product partnerships, said the fact that over 30 new Indian partners have signed up shows how there were a lot of people passionate about the cause. Among the new services on the platform are English Dost, MeraDoctor, M-Kisan, My Rights and SkyMet. While Facebook will not have advertisements on the platform, Archibong said the partners were free to do what they wanted. ""We don't want to prohibit any business model.""
Daniels said initiatives like Internet.org were necessary as a majority of the word is not connected and the rate at which new users are coming online is coming down. ""The ecosystem is not going to solve this,"" he said, adding that India, for instance, had over a billion people not connected to the Internet.
Facebook lists the barriers to adoption of Internet as infrastructure, affordability and awareness and is experimenting with solar powered aircraft and terrestrial services to plug the gaps in connectivity across the world.

"88",88,"National Encryption Policy: Government Issues Clarification on WhatsApp, Social Media
by Sriram Sharma and Gopal Sathe , 21 September 2015
If a draft proposal by government's Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) becomes the law in its current form, you might be asked to retain certain forms of digital communication for a period of 90 days.
Update 22 September 1:40am: The government issued an addendum to clarify that ""mass use encryption products, which are currently being used in web applications, social media sites, and social media applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc."" While that language is vague in itself, you can rest easy without needing to worry about having to store your WhatsApp messages for 90 days. The original text continues below.
The DeitY has posted a draft National Encryption Policy on its website inviting comments from the public on its mission, strategies, objectives, and regulatory framework, which you can send to akrishnan@deity.gov.in, until 16th October 2015. A lot of the details mentioned in the draft guidelines are worrying, and this is a topic that concerns every consumer.
While the draft encryption policy's preamble starts by talking about improving e-governance and e-commerce through better security and privacy measures, it very quickly brings up national security as well, and that's where things get worrying from a consumer's perspective. It's very reminiscent of when the Indian government was thinking about banning BBM in India unless BlackBerry (then Research in Motion) gave security agencies access to snoop on emails . The two would eventually reach an arrangement that allowed the government to intercept email .
The language of the new draft policy is quite clear on one thing - businesses and consumers may use encryption for storage and communication, but the encryption algorithms and key sizes will be prescribed by the Indian government. What's more, vendors of encryption products would have to register in India (with the exception of mass use products, such as SSL), and citizens are allowed to use only the products registered in India.
""Would OpenPGP, a commonly-used standard for encryption of email, fall under 'mass use'?"" asks Pranesh Prakash, Policy Director at the Centre for Internet and Society, speaking to Gadgets 360. ""Because if it doesn't, I am prohibited from using it. But if it does, I am required to copy-paste all my encrypted mails into a separate document to store it in plain text, as required by the draft policy. Is that what it really intends? Has the government thought this through?""
Most people don't explicitly use encryption, but it's built into apps they use every day. Do the draft guidelines also extend to products and services with built-in encryption like WhatsApp? If yes - and the language certainly suggests it does - then combine them with governments requirements for its citizens, as proposed in the draft guidelines, and we could have very worrying scenarios.
The draft guidelines read ""All citizens (C), including personnel of Government/ Business (G/B) performing non-official/ personal functions, are required to store the plaintexts of the corresponding encrypted information for 90 days from the date of transaction and provide the verifiable Plain Text to Law and Enforcement Agencies as and when required as per the provision of the laws of the country.""
WhatsApp messages are now encrypted end-to-end . So do the draft guidelines mean you have to store a copy of all your WhatsApp messages for 90 days? What about Snapchat? Or any other form of ephemeral messaging that is automatically deleted after being read? The consumer is expected to maintain plain text copies of all communications for 90 days - so that these can be produced if required by the laws of the land - so, will it even legal to read a message that deletes itself, if and when the draft guidelines become law?
The draft policy document states that the vision is to create an information security environment, and secure transactions. But the actual details mentioned in the draft appear to do the opposite, and put a focus more on the lines of limiting encryption only to technologies that likely could be intercepted by the government, when required.
This is in many ways similar to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's draft letter on Net Neutrality, which instead talked about issues like cyberbullying and 'sexting' . In the feedback period, Trai received over 1 million emails . but the Department of Telecom report on Net Neutrality also went against public sentiment on certain things, suggesting that telcos should be allowed to charge extra for specific services , such as Skype or WhatsApp voice calls in India, showing that calls for feedback aren't necessarily being taken seriously.
And, with the draft National Encryption Policy, another problem that is shared with the Net Neutrality discussions , is the use of vague language. The result is that there is very little clarity at this point on what will and will not be permitted by the government if the draft guidelines are adopted. We're living in a time when the government talks about how WhatsApp and Gmail may be used by ""anti-national elements"", and even considered requiring Twitter and Facebook to establish servers in India .
With that in mind, you have to ask, will it be even legal to use WhatsApp if these guidelines are implemented? After all, WhatsApp messages have end-to-end encryption and if this service does not register in India, and comply with the algorithms prescribed by the government, then as a citizen of India, you won't be allowed to use it because ""users in India are allowed to use only the products registered in India,"" as per the draft guidelines.
If the draft policy comes into affect, businesses need to provide the plain text message, and the encrypted pair, to verify that the intercepted encrypted communication is indeed the same as the plain text message that they are providing to law enforcement or intelligence agencies, when asked as per the laws of the country.
""There is an assumption here, that given the same plain text, you always get the encrypted text. This assumption is wrong,"" Prakash says. ""It holds for some forms of encryption, but does not necessarily hold for all forms of encryption. If there's a changing salt, it won't lead to the same encrypted text each time.""
Prakash also argues against the draft specifying the hashing mechanisms, algorithm, and the key length. He says the government should instead be setting a minimum encryption strength for various sectors, like financial data, health data, or governmental use, adding that algorithms cited were outdated and broken.
""Of the 3 symmetric cryptographic primitives that are listed - AES, 3DES, and RC4 - one, RC4, has been shown to be a broken cipher. It is unimaginable that they would be mandating it as one of the three currently permissible. They are weakening national security by doing so!""
These are questions that don't just affect a few people, but just about every Indian who is using the mobile Internet. In its present form, the draft actually severely limits what you can do online, and could hobble the push for a digital India. There's almost a full month to give our feedback, but is anyone listening?

At 12.2 inches, Samsung's Galaxy Tab Pro is a pretty big tablet. It'll be dwarfed by the one they're working on now, though: it measures a foot and a half along its diagonal.
Samsung is thought to be working on an 18.4-inch tablet that they've codenamed Tahoe - possibly because in tablet terms it's as big and imposing as Chevrolet's SUV by the same name. Calling the Tahoe a tablet seems like a bit of a stretch, though. At 18.4 inches, it's more likely that Samsung is working on an all-in-one device that spends most of its time docked on a desktop (or a kitchen counter).
Other PC manufacturers have already turned out several systems like this. There's the Dell XPS 18, the Sony Vaio Tap 20, and the HP Envy Rove 20. They all run Windows, however, and Samsung is reportedly going to put Android on the Tahoe instead - like an un-docked Asus Transformer AIO.
Dell's XPS 18
Android 5.1, to be precise. Samsung is also planning to use their own Exynos 7580 processor in the device, a 64-bit octa-core chip clocked at 1.6GHz. That's the same processor Samsung opted for in the recently-launched Galaxy J7 (a budget smartphone that just launched in India), which indicates that the Tahoe will have a small price tag despite its extra-large profile.
Its 1080p display is another indication, as is the ARM Mali-T720 GPU driving its visuals. ARM has positioned it as an option for entry-level and mid-range devices, so this could be more of a scaled-up Galaxy Tab A than an addition to Samsung's Tab S higher-end line-up.

Samsung Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6, the flagship handsets that were launched running Android 5.0 Lollipop, have reportedly started receiving the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update.
As per the latest report, the Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update is being rolled out over the air (OTA) to T-Mobile users in the US, but is also available through the Samsung Kies software. Samsung has not officially announced the roll-out of Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update for the flagships. However, since the latest firmware's rollout has begun in the US, it is safe to expect the update to reach other regions including India soon.
Besides including several bug fixes for the devices, the latest Android 5.1.1 Lollipop update for Galaxy S6 and Galaxy S6 Edge is said to introduce small yet useful features. The update, according to Sammobile, now comes with an easier to use exposure control system for the handset's camera alongside a wallpaper with parallax effect, which we first saw on iPhone devices. Several other user interface changes such as option to remove S Finder and quick connect buttons from the notifications section, have also been included in the latest OS version. The overall performance of the smartphones is said to have improved as well.
Android 5.1.1 Lollipop was earlier this month rolled out to Android One smartphones in India. Android 5.1.1 is also anticipated to bring a fix for the memory leak issue , a bug that plagued Android 5.0 Lollipop users and even haunted some users on Android 5.1 Lollipop.
Meanwhile Samsung on Monday introduced the Emerald Green colour variant of the Galaxy S6 Edge in India. The smartphone until now was only present in White Pearl, Black Sapphire and Gold Platinum colour variants. The new colour variant will be available in 32GB inbuilt storage version only.

Doubts over the sales prospects of Samsung Electronics Co Ltd's new flagship smartphones are damping expectations of a rapid turnaround for the South Korean giant, even though profit likely continues to recover from last year's troughs.
After peaking in mid-March as favourable reviews for the new Galaxy S6 models boosted earnings hopes, the company's stock price has languished and was down nearly 6 percent for the year as of mid-day trade on Monday. Supply shortages for the curved-screen S6 edge and economic headwinds in Europe and China have lowered expectations.
""After the first-quarter results the consensus for second-quarter earnings was somewhere in the high 7 trillion won ($6.22 billion), but now I think so long as the first digit doesn't start with a six it won't be a shock,"" HDC Asset Management fund manager Park Jung-hoon said.
The average forecast from a Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey of 39 analysts tips April-June operating profit at 7.2 trillion won, the same as a year earlier and up from 6 trillion won in January-March. Of those surveyed, 20 have cut their forecasts in the past 30 days by an average of 3.9 percent.
Samsung is expected to guide its second-quarter revenue and profit on Tuesday, with full results to follow at end-July.
To be sure, analysts say the trend of gradual earnings recovery remains intact. The Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S survey tips 2015 profit to recover to 27.8 trillion won from the three-year low of 25 trillion won in 2014. Third and fourth-quarter profits this year are expected at 7.3 trillion won and 7.5 trillion won, respectively, posting significant gains in annual terms.
Samsung expects the new phones to be their best-selling devices to date. Data from researcher Counterpoint released in June showed that Samsung sold 6 million S6 smartphones from the April 10 launch to the end of the month, outpacing the previous S5 model in the same time frame.
But analysts say Samsung's failure to anticipate demand for the S6 edge led to a missed opportunity. Though the firm says it now has enough capacity to meet demand for the curved-screen model, its flagship phones will soon need to compete with new Apple Inc iPhones that analysts expect will launch as early as September.
""As the smartphone market matures, the period of time that consumer demand for a high-end product lasts looks to have gotten shorter,"" KTB Investment analyst Jin Sung-hye said in a report, cutting her 2015 Galaxy S6 shipments forecast to 45 million from 49 million previously.

"92",92,"India Drops to #131 in UN's Broadband Penetration Rankings
Press Trust of India , 22 September 2015
India has slipped in global rankings on broadband penetration but has  made slight progress in the percentage of individuals using Internet in  the country, according to a United Nations report.
The UN Broadband  Commission released 'The State of Broadband' report Monday just ahead of  the forthcoming Sustainable Development Goals Summit at UN and the  parallel meeting of the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development  on September 26.
The report says that 57 percent of the world's  people remain offline and unable to take advantage of the enormous  economic and social benefits the Internet can offer. India ranked 131  out of 189 countries on fixed-broadband subscriptions in 2014, a drop  from the 125th rank a year before.
On active mobile-broadband  subscriptions, India ranked 155, a significant drop from the 113th rank  in 2013. India ranked 136th in individuals using the Internet in 2014,  with 18 percent individuals using the net, an improvement over the 142nd  rank in 2013 when 15.1 percent individuals used the Internet.
India  ranked 80 among 133 developing countries on percentage of households  with Internet in 2014 with a 15.3 percent penetration as compared to the  75th rank and 13 percent penetration in 2013.
The report said  that in order to connect everyone, it is vital to increase the online  representation of many of the world's languages, especially for regions  and countries with high linguistic diversity such as Africa, India and  South-East Asia.
""The UN Sustainable Development Goals remind us  that we need to measure global development by the number of those being  left behind,"" said Houlin Zhao, who serves as co-Vice Chair of the  Commission with UNESCO Director-General Irina Bokova.
""The market  has done its work connecting the world's wealthier nations, where a  strong business case for network roll-out can easily be made. Our  important challenge now is to find ways of getting online the four  billion people who still lack the benefits of Internet connectivity, and  this will be a primary focus of the Broadband Commission going  forward,"" Zhao said.
The report said 3.2 billion people are now  connected, up from 2.9 billion last year and equating to 43 percent of  the global population.
But while access to the Internet is  approaching saturation levels in the developed world, the net is only  accessible to 35 percent of people in developing countries.
The  situation in the UN-designated Least Developed Countries is particularly  critical, with over 90 percent of people without any kind of Internet  connectivity.
In total, there are now 79 countries where over 50  per cent of the population is online, up from 77 in 2014. The top ten  countries for Internet use are all located in Europe.

Vodafone joins 4G race, launch in December
Vodafone 4G will be available in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Kochi by 2015-end.
By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi |
Updated: August 29, 2015 1:39 am
Vodafone India said it will launch 4G services by the end of calendar year 2015 in important data markets, including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Kochi.
The mobile telephony market is set to sizzle with competition, with Vodafone India, the country's second largest mobile operator by revenue and subscriber base, also joining the race for launch of 4G services by the end of the current calendar year. Rival Bharti Airtel launched such services across 300 cities earlier this month and Mukesh Ambani's Reliance Jio Infocomm plans to do so in December. Idea Cellular has already said it will launch 4G services in the next calendar year.
On Friday, Vodafone India said it will launch 4G services by the end of calendar year 2015 in important data markets, including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Bengaluru and Kochi. ""In addition, Vodafone India will also roll out its 3G networks in seven circles - Assam, North East, UP West, Rajasthan, Karnataka, Kerala and Odisha, to expand its overall 3G footprint to 16 circles across the country,"" a company statement said.
It said the company had acquired additional 4G (LTE) spectrum in Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata, Kerala and Karnataka circles in the February 2014 auctions, and they together contribute close to 50% of total data revenue for it.
With big operators getting into the 4G space, which enables surfing the web on mobile phones, tablets and laptops much faster than 3G services, consumers can once again expect to get the best in terms of tariff, data packages, movies and song downloads coupled with snazzy devices, as the operators jostle for a share of their wallet.
For a sneak preview of what the consumers could get: Airtel, has a tariff plan - Infinity Plans - where at Rs 999 the company is offering unlimited local voice calls on Airtel-to-Airtel
network along with 3GB data benefits and access to Wynk Movies and Wynk Music.
This gets scaled up to Rs 1,999, wherein 7GB of data comes with unlimited local, STD calls, and free roaming services with unlimited Wynk songs and movies.

In our latest 5.5-inch octa-core roundup, we have a well-known Samsung Galaxy J7 against the pretender Meizu MX5 who is well on its way in moving up ranks in the smartphone industry. Both are available on a budget despite having great specs which sound good to us.
- Advertisement - 
Let's have some background information on both of them, shall we? We already have Samsung with its flagship A-series making a success with the stylish metal outlook. This time around, the J-series is meant to be its mid-range offerings to the market. This is where Samsung's strength lies in, they seem to have a smartphone for everyone. But can it compete against the Chinese on its own turf? We will find out soon enough.
Frankly speaking, not many of us outside of the native China would know the name Meizu. But it is about time they should get some international recognition for what they can achieve and start promoting their brand and their products out to the international market. Surely they can't keep quiet from the outside world of their great specs and a decent price that they dish out for any longer.
We'll start off with the usual stuffs first. The Galaxy J7 has a body measurement of 152.2 x 79.1 x 7.9 mm (5.99 x 3.11 x 0.31 in) and weighing 169 g (5.96 oz). It sure does have a slim and light profile. Too bad it does not have a metal body to complement its slimness.
Compare that to the MX5's body of 149.9 x 74.7 x 7.6 mm (5.90 x 2.94 x 0.30 in) and 149 g (5.26 oz), we have a winner right away. Being just 7.6mm thin, it features great design packed in an all-metal body. They have developed a state of the art coloring and injection molding process, which frees the metal back from unattractive antenna lines. The outcome is an exquisite 12-gun 3D sand blasting, a 5 step anodizing process and superb fine polishing, which makes the MX5 looks amazing. If that isn't enough, at the back of the smartphone; you can see that the dual-tone flash and laser focus module that are assembled for a sleek rear design. The close Fresnel lens and round camera module look great together. Then there's the diamond blue coating, low tone and depth that reinforces the MX5's look from any angle.
The all-metal body and stylish outlook makes the MX5 a clear winner and the Galaxy J7 doesn't stand a chance it seems. But what about the other aspects that make up a smartphone?
As for the screen, the Galaxy J7 is sporting a 5.5-inch High Definition TFT capacitive touchscreen of 720 x 1280 pixels or ~267 ppi pixel density which makes for a decent screen. It is a little wonder why it is still using TFT when others have been making full use of the IPS technology. Cost-saving maybe, but it certainly doesn't help in its case. Seems like a dated technology or Samsung is looking for a dumping ground for some of its older inventory and the Galaxy J7 is the answer.
Meanwhile on the MX5, it is sporting a 5.5-inch Full HD AMOLED screen with 1080 x 1920 pixels or ~401 ppi pixel density, you can be sure of good-looking images being projected onto the screen. Right from the very beginning, AMOLED surpasses traditional LCD technology in terms of contrast. The 10000:1 contrast ratio, which is very close to the limit of the naked eye, provides the screen with bright, sharp and expressive colors. A unique feature of AMOLED is that every single pixel lightens up individually, actively reducing power consumption to zero in dark-hued pictures. Furthermore, it has a higher color gamut expression with a typical value as high as 100% displays colors as natural as they get. It also has a wide visual angle that is close to 90°, making extreme visual angles, not a single problem. It also ensures that colors always look precise, even when looked at from the side. This makes sharing the screen with a friend or two enjoyable. Plus, this is also the thinnest display in the entire history of Meizu. Being only 1.3mm thin, it is 32% thinner than the MX4. It looks as if the structure was floating on glass. The response sensitivity has also been improved significantly.
Again, pound-for-pound the technology for Galaxy J7's screen already looks dated as compared to the latest tech found on the MX5. Everything points to an avalanche that again makes the MX5 the clear winner.
Next up is the internal side of things. We have the Galaxy J7 and its Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 chipset, an Octa-core processor comprising Quad-core 1.4 GHz Cortex-A53 & quad-core 1.0 GHz Cortex-A53, Adreno 405 graphics, and 1.5GB RAM. That's another odd thing that Samsung decided to go for just 1.5GB memory? Why can't it have 2GB like others in this mid-range space? Again, it is another perplexing move by the Koreans.
The MX5 instead will be powered by the Mediatek MT6795 chipset paired with an Octa-core 2.2 GHz Cortex-A53 processor, PowerVR G6200 MP4 graphics and 3GB RAM. Now that is some pretty serious hardware that guarantees that you won't face any issues in running all of the latest apps and games that are out there in the market.
Even though both of them have an octa-core processor, the MX5 has a better chipset, faster processor speed and double the size of the memory as compared to the Galaxy J7. This points to the MX5 being a lot better than the Galaxy J7.
- Advertisement - 
Perhaps the Galaxy J7's saving grace is its 13 Megapixel primary camera and 5 Megapixel secondary camera. Then again, Samsung has something up its sleeve with its secondary camera all set to have a flash that ensures a better selfie picture even under low light conditions.
Meanwhile on the MX5, it will be getting an awesome 20.7 Megapixel primary camera that certainly packs a heavy punch. Their partnership with the SONY IMX220 lens in the past year has brought several improved software algorithms: white balance, sharpening, color tuning and shutter logic. All these are well implemented in the MX5. Armed with a brand new 6P lens and laser-aided focusing technology, you will get to experience unprecedented clarity when taking your favorite photos. The brand new shutter logic and the f/2.2 large aperture lens form a basis for creating pictures of outstanding quality. The upgraded algorithm for white balance and sharpening enable the MX5 to perform well and stable, even in complex environments. Combined with the brand new DM3.0 image algorithm, the MX5 has improved performance in skin color treatment and low light noise reduction. Not satisfied with that, there's the brand new 5.0-megapixel front camera which is equipped with a large f/2.0 aperture that optimizes performance even under low light conditions. With FotoNation 2.0 intelligent beautification, it is being used in combination with the existing Face AE facial exposure strengthening technology. Just press the shutter button and your pictures will automatically be beautified in an instant.
The MX5's 20.7MP-5MP camera versus Galaxy J's 13MP-5MP camera, and you have another clear winner in the MX5.
By taking lots and lots of pictures, you're going to need a good amount of storage right? Indeed, the Galaxy J7 comes with 16GB of internal storage plus there's also a microSD slot which allows for an additional 128GB.
As for the MX5, you have to be very careful though since it does not have an expansion slot. You got to choose from 16 GB, 32GB or 64GB whichever your budget allows you. Just make sure you don't regret it later if you run out of space pretty fast. In any case, there's always cloud storage that you can tap into.
Now that's something to cheer about on the Galaxy J7, but seems like it is a little bit too late.
On the software side of things, both the Galaxy J7 and MX5 would have the latest Android Lollipop update right out of the. No worries over there.
Battery-wise, the Galaxy J7 is powered by a Li-Ion 3000 mAh battery which is considerably fair for its size and power. Expect it to be able to last you for at least a day in between charging.
Compare that to the MX5 which packs a non-removable 3150 mAh battery which should also have no problems powering up the device for a day or two in between charging.
Also do take note that both of them have dual-sim capability and 4G LTE connectivity as well, which is a plus point.
Finally, the MX5 has a fingerprint sensor which makes unlocking the screen or performing banking transactions so much easier. The entire module has been redesigned, bringing you a better industrial design, a higher recognition speed and an improved user experience. The brand new capsule-shaped home button integrates perfectly with the simplified and unified design of the phone's body. Normally it is reserved for higher-end (and more expensive) models, but Meizu does incorporate it into the MX5; which is the icing on the cake.

The Samsung Galaxy J7 is at best, looking to be average from the looks of things. Good luck to Samsung to be able to penetrate the Chinese market with this smartphone.
Considering the amazing specs and how many features are inside the MX5, it certainly provides real value for money. How Meizu does that is a miracle and the Galaxy J7 certainly don't stand a chance against it.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 is expected to be released in the next couple of months and will be available for approximately $290 USD. It will be available in black, white and gold.
Whereas for Meizu MX5, it is available for pre-order for approximately $309 USD for the 16GB model and will start to ship out on August 1st. The only issue might be to keep up with the expected crazy demand.

While being resistant to dust and water is a very useful feature, the Sony Xperia M4 Aqua does fall short in other key areas when compared to the, in some cases cheaper, competition.

When it comes to the highly-competitive mid-range smartphone world, it is quite difficult to distinguish between one device and another in the sea of smartphones that make up this segment. OEMs are now depending on using a key selling point to help their device stand out from the rest, be it pricing, battery life, camera, design and build quality, and more. In the case of the latest mid-range offering from Sony, that key selling point comes in the form of a signature Sony flagship feature, water resistance. Does choosing to focus on a single element result in corners being cut in other areas? We find out, in this Sony Xperia M4 Aqua review!
Design
The Xperia M4 Aqua retains a lot of the design language of previous Sony smartphones, which isn't particularly surprising at this point, given that Sony's design strategy has been largely of the incremental nature, across their entire portfolio of devices. The use of the two glass panels, as seen with the high-end Sony devices, is certainly a nice touch and looks great, even if they are prone to fingerprints. It is in the presence of a plastic frame though that the mid-range nature of this device comes through, and unfortunately feels quite out of place. The mix of the premium-feeling glass and the cheaper plastic is quite unsettling, and makes the phone feel awkward in the hand.

The signature Sony power button returns at its usual location on the right side, ideally placed to be within easy reach. The volume rocker right below it and the dedicated camera shutter button at the bottom of the right side don't leave a lot of room to comfortably rest your thumb on this side of the device though. The SIM card slot is above the power button, and the microSD card slot falls on the opposite side, both covered by flaps that are necessary to maintain its waterproof nature.  Just above the microSD card slot is the microUSB port, which is a very different placement from what most of us would be used to. Finally, the headphone jack and single speaker unit are found at the top and bottom respectively.
With the bulk of the buttons and ports placed on the sides of the device, it does look like quite a lot is going on, and takes away from the minimalistic design we've come to expect from Sony. Up front, above the display, is a notification LED on the left of the Sony branding, with a 5 MP front-facing camera on the other side. The Xperia M4 Aqua is still quite thin and light though, with a thickness of just 7.3 mm, and weighing 136 grams. The Xperia M4 Aqua is still quite thin and light though, with a thickness of just 7.3 mm, and weighing 136 grams, and its relatively compact size allows for a comfortable handling experience.
Display
The Xperia M4 Aqua comes with a 5-inch IPS LCD display, with a 720p resolution, resulting in a pixel density of 294 ppi. As is expected from IPS technology, the viewing angles this display offers are fantastic, but the colors aren't particularly vivid though, as they are with some other devices that fall in this price range. The display is just decent overall, and not very impressive.
Performance and Hardware
Under the hood, the Xperia M4 Aqua packs an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 processor, clocked at 1.5 GHz, and backed by the Adreno 405 GPU and 2 GB of RAM. This processing package is found with quite a few mid-range smartphones and has proven to be very capable, which is also the case here. Day to day performance is smooth and stutter-free, and multi-tasking is a breeze. The device also handles gaming very well, with no issues save for the most processor-intensive of games. While obviously not as fast as the flagships of the world, Xperia M4 Aqua is certainly very reliable in terms of performance.
One area of concern though is the heat output of the device. The Xperia M4 Aqua does tend to get uncomfortably warm to the touch not just while gaming, but even when performing simple tasks like using the camera or downloading apps. There is significant throttling to prevent overheating, but that is definitely not the ideal solution to this performance issue that is becoming more prevalent with the latest Qualcomm processors.
The Xperia M4 Aqua comes with 8 GB or 16 GB of on-board storage, expandable via microSD card by up to 128 GB. The 8 GB version does come with only 1.5 GB available to the user though, so it'll be a better idea to opt for the 16 GB iteration if you do decide to pick up this device. The usual suite of sensors and connectivity options are available, including support for 4G LTE, but carrier compatibility does vary with each model, so make sure that you check the frequency bands of the model you are getting before picking up the device. For example, this particular review unit is restricted to HSPA+ on the AT&T network.
The single speaker unit at the bottom of the device isn't great, with the sound distorted and tinny, along with the volume being on the quieter side. As is the case with any device with a bottom-mounted speaker, it is also fairly easy to cover up the speaker and muffle the sound when holding the device in the landscape orientation.
Coming to what is the key selling point of this device, the Xperia M4 Aqua is well protected from the elements, courtesy of its IP68 rating for resistance to dust and water. What this means is that the device can be submerged in up to 1.5 metres of water for as long as 30 minutes, with no negative impact on usability and performance.
The device comes with a 2,400 mAh that is not replaceable, and offers a battery life that is just about average. In my daily use, the device lasted for around 16 hours with 2.5 hours of screen-on time, with usage that involved watching videos on Youtube and scrolling through social media, apart from other general tasks. While not bad, the battery doesn't stand up to Sony's claim of the device lasting comfortably for two days. There are a few power saving modes available in the Settings menu, that you might have to take advantage of to get that little bit of extra juice out of this battery.

Camera
The Xperia M4 Aqua comes with a 13 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front-facing shooter. The rear camera proves to be very capable, with the shots rich in detail and very sharp, even if the colors did lack some punch. The minimalistic camera has only a few modes available, including a manual mode that lets you select between multiple scene types and adjust the white balance. Additional camera modes are available though, which can be downloaded separately.
Software
On the software front, the Xperia M4 Aqua comes with a slightly skinned version of Android 5.0 Lollipop, which also takes on a more colorful motif than the Xperia UI of old. There are some very useful options available, such as the ability to customize the Quick Settings menu with the toggles you most use, screen recording, and also the staple Small Apps menu, which is a tad unpolished in its appearance, but still very useful.
There is some bloatware to be found though, with a slew of apps, including AA Stocks, AVG Protection, and News from Sociallife coming pre-installed, but most of them can be easily removed though. Another negative is the placement of the hamburger menu in the app drawer, that gets in the way when attempting to swipe right, and can be quite frustrating.

Reviewed by AP technology writer Anick Jesdanun
A better design, sharper camera and easier to use software make the new Galaxy S6 phones the best Samsung has yet to offer.
Although Samsung has been praised for its improved hardware, much of what I like is in the software specifically, what's not in it. After a few years of making phones difficult to use with a slew of questionable features, Samsung continues to streamline its phones with the S6.
The Samsung Galaxy S6 will be available at Rs 49,900 (32 GB), Rs 55,900 (64GB), Rs 61,900 (128GB) while the Galaxy S6 Edge costs Rs 58,900 (32 GB), Rs 64,900 (64 GB) and Rs 70,900 (128 GB).

Here are 5 things to know about the phones:
Handling:
Gone is the cheap-looking plastic back. The design is more stylish, with metal sides and a glass back, similar to older iPhones. Although I like the look, the glass makes the phone feel slippery, like a shiny marble countertop. Get a case; the regular S6 phone slipped out of my hands a few times. Apple's iPhones now have metal backs and feel sturdier to grip. That said, the Edge version doesn't feel as slippery, perhaps because I'm gripping the back part tighter given that the screen curves halfway down the sides.

Camera:
I'm impressed with the images I've taken so far. Many of the shots had great focus, matching the performance of the iPhone 6. Colors on a green store sign weren't as strong as those shot with Samsung's Galaxy Note 4 and that's good. While stunning, colors on Note 4 images sometimes look unnatural. I haven't noticed that so far on the S6.

One nice touch: Quickly double tap the home button to launch the camera, even when the screen is off. Though most phones let you launch the camera from the lock screen, I still lose shots in the time it takes to slide or tap the right icon.
Watching video:
I liked the rich colors produced by Samsung's Amoled screen technology as I watched ""Mad Men"" on Netflix. But I found the controls very sensitive. Video stopped several times as I inadvertently hit the back button, which is built into the phone's frame. In addition, video often paused when I mistakenly touched the edge of the screen, launching the notification bar. You must handle the phone with care.

Software:
Samsung's software improvements are subtle yet welcome. The most noticeable change is replacing many icons with text. For instance, there's a tool for searching through your settings. Previous Samsung phones depicted that as a magnifying glass icon. On S6 phones, it simply says ""SEARCH."" Same goes for controls such as ""EDIT"" and ""MORE."" This applies only to Samsung features and apps, though. You'll still get mysterious icons with third-party apps.

You also get the latest version of Android, Lollipop. Benefits include bringing notifications to the lock screen, similar to iPhones. That saves a lot of taps getting to the message you want. You can restrict what appears there if you're sensitive to prying eyes.
Pushing the EDGE
The Edge model's side displays enable some nifty features, such as having the sides flash a different color based on who's calling. But the Edge comes across as something still looking for more practical uses.

The regular S6 model will be fine for most people. Both models come with a fingerprint scanner for unlocking the phone. Both also have fast-charging capabilities; I got to 47 percent in just 30 minutes on the regular S6. The phones remain at 5.1 inches diagonally, just a tad larger than the iPhone 6, which got a size boost over the previous year's models.
The new S6 phones show that Samsung's more than a big screen. I look forward to seeing how Apple responds with new models this fall.

"99",99,"by Jamshed Avari , 13 April 2015
It's been a tumultuous year for Samsung.  Buoyant and complacent with being the world's most successful Android  smartphone vendor for ages, the Korean giant was perhaps not prepared  for its Galaxy S5 flagship last year to be so roundly criticised for not  breaking any new ground. The heart rate sensor was pretty much mostly a  gimmick, and the glossy plastic body did it no favours when seen next  to its competition. Chinese brands have started having an impact on  its low-end and mid-range sales, and Lollipop updates for older devices  have been coming too slowly, if at all.
Samsung's image has lost a  lot of its former sheen; even more so when it comes to the top-end  Galaxy S range. Under more pressure than ever before, the company is  betting on a major reinvention. Gone is the cheap plastic, in favour of  slick aluminium. Gone is the heavy TouchWiz skin with dozens of settings  and features that no one ever used - the software is more restrained than ever.
We first saw the new Samsung Galaxy S6 (and its eclectic curved-glass twin, the Galaxy S6 Edge )  shortly after its launch at the 2015 Mobile World Congress show, but  now we've had enough time to conduct a full, thorough review. The device  is launching in India just over a month after its global debut, making  it the first of this year's flagship models to make it here.  Should you  rush out and buy one?
Look and feel
Samsung has been  experimenting with metal bodies up and down its product lineup, so it's  no surprise that the new flagship model comes in full aluminium trim.  Samsung's phones have been difficult to tell apart in the past because  of the company's very set template, and the Galaxy S6 feels like something of a  missed opportunity in terms of a breakout design. With new materials and new  priorities, Samsung could have gone in exciting directions but the  Galaxy S6 not only carries forward most of its predecessors' style, it  somehow simultaneously manages to look like it has borrowed cues from Sony and Apple .
While the influence of the iPhone 6 ( Review | Pictures ) and its predecessors is apparent in  details such as the machined speaker grille and chamfered rim edges, we  find that the overall shape and style feel more derivative of the Sony  Xperia Z3 ( Review | Pictures ). Other touches, such as the silver-rimmed physical Home button  are pure Samsung.
The front and back are flat glass, and the  metal rim has a slight curve that fits nicely in a hand. Thankfully, the Galaxy S5 ( Review | Pictures ) rim's ugly ridges were smoothened out. The power button and  Nano-SIM tray are on the right, and two separate volume buttons are on  the left. The only things on top are an IR emitter and secondary mic,  while the speaker, Micro-USB port and headset socket are all on the  bottom. Flaps over the ports and slots for waterproofing are  conspicuously absent. The home button has an integrated fingerprint  reader and there's also a heart rate sensor right beneath the flash on  the rear.
Samsung has clearly shifted its priorities as far as  design is concerned, and this is the first Galaxy S model not to have an  accessible battery. Also as a consequence, there's no room for a  microSD card slot - you'll have to choose a storage capacity at the time  of purchase and then live with that much.
The biggest problem  with the design is that this phone is extremely slippery. We often found  ourselves uncertain of our grip on it; holding it extra tight to  compensate. The camera module sticks out quite a bit from the rear -  it's larger and more obtrusive than the infamous one on the iPhone 6 ,  and the Galaxy S6 wobbles when you try to use it lying face up on a table.
Specifications
The  fact that Samsung has gone with its in-house Exynos processor for all  global versions of the Galaxy S6 signals the company's growing  confidence in its ability to compete with top-tier technology firms such  as Qualcomm. The Exynos 7420 SoC has four 1.5GHz ARM Cortex A53 cores  and four 2.1GHz Cortex A57 cores, allowing the phone to strike a balance  between performance and power consumption for all kinds of tasks.  There's 3GB of RAM, which is standard for top-end phones now.
With  no microSD card slot, Samsung has made the Galaxy S6 available in  multiple storage configurations. The strategy and pricing follow Apple's  precedents, but the base model comes with 32GB rather than 16GB, which  seems like a direct shot across the bow.
Predictably, the screen  moves up to QHD resolution, which is 1440x2560 pixels. At 5.1 inches  diagonally, it's a lot easier to handle than last year's QHD flagships.  The screen is beautifully crisp and bright, and it's protected by  Gorilla Glass 4.
Like last year's Galaxy S5, the physical Home  button has an integrated fingerprint sensor, but now you don't have to  swipe your finger across it - a simple touch will do. The heart rate  sensor on the rear is also still around. We found the one on the Galaxy  S5 gimmicky and ultimately forgettable. This one is positioned to one  side of the camera hump, making less likely that regular usage will  become a habit.
Software
Samsung has famously reduced a lot  of the software clutter that defined its Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5  devices. TouchWiz has tried to mimic some of Google's Lollipop-era  Material Design aesthetic and it is a marked improvement over previous  Samsung attempts at UI design. Responsiveness isn't a problem, and we  never got the feeling that any of the customisations were a step  backwards from stock Android.
There are some things that you might  never use, but are fairly unobtrusive and can be disabled, such as the  Fliboard-style news reader to the left of the primary home screen, and  the ability to run two apps simultaneously in a split-screen mode. The  quick settings and notifications shade is handy - for example, grabbing  the brightness slider makes all other controls temporarily disappear  from the screen, letting you see how your adjustment will affect the  underlying app or content.
Interestingly, there's now a Themes  app and an associated online store from which you can download packs  that give your Galaxy S6 UI a complete visual overhaul. We noticed a few  branded options, so presumably Samsung is open to licensing deals. We  hope to see more variety in the store soon .
There are still  significant amounts of Samsung-branded bloat, such as the Galaxy  Essentials and Galaxy Gifts apps and widget. It looks like a bunch of  apps such as Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram are  preloaded, but these icons take you do download pages which means they  aren't taking up as much space by default. You also get the Peel Smart  Remote app with which to use the IR blaster.
Of course one of the  biggest stories here is the default inclusion of Microsoft apps and  services , right in Google's stronghold. Skype, OneDrive and OneNote are  preloaded, though not the Microsoft Office apps which would compete  directly with Google's offerings. OneNote is fantastically useful and  any use of OneDrive is a toe-hold for the company. Any more than this  and users would have been faced with confusing choices.
S-Health  is still around, tied in to the heart rate monitor on the rear but more  realistically useful if you have a smartwatch or dedicated monitoring  device. The app lists compatible accessories including of course the  Samsung Gear range, plus devices from Garmin, Adidas and others. We  didn't wind up getting much use out of S-Health during our review  period, but it will probably be useful over time to those who make it  part of their daily routine.
Camera
Flagship phones today  are distinguished by their cameras, and the Samsung Galaxy S6 does very  well indeed in this department. We were constantly amazed by the quality  of photos we were able to take, and the accuracy of subtle little  details. Daylight shots were extraordinarily impressive, especially when  we were able to frame shots to get some depth of field. Close-ups  revealed that the camera can reproduce fine textures and really make  colours pop.
We were satisfied with the compression and noise  levels too, even in low light. While ambient lighting made a huge  difference to the colour accuracy of shots and the autofocus was often  unreliable at night, we were more than impressed with the results we  were able to capture. We have only seen better low-light results from  the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.

4K video came out well, though we  still feel that there aren't many occasions on which 4K makes more  sense than regular 1080p - especially if you go for the lowest-priced  32GB model. A 30-second 4K clip came to around 170MB, while an  equivalent 1080p clip took up just 60MB. The phone warns you that some  features, such as continuous autofocus and still grabs aren't possible  while recording in 4K, and we also found this to be the only time when  the phone really got hot in our hands.
Samsung's camera app has  also undergone a significant makeover. The massive grid of settings has  been distilled into a few options on screen, with a deeper menu for  things that spill over. A manual mode lets you drag sliders to adjust the focus and exposure compensation, which is really neat.
(Click to see full size)
There's a modular approach to features - a  ""Camera Mode store"" lets you add things that aren't already there, such  as a mode for sports or fast-moving objects, one for food, a face  beautifier, dual-cam PIP, and many more fringe use cases. It's a lot  better than having a thousand options by default, and we wonder if paid  camera software enhancements are on the way.
Performance
Samsung  clearly believes its Exynos processors are mature enough to bet the  entire flagship Galaxy S line on, and we found that its confidence is  not misplaced. The Galaxy S6 will go up against multiple devices powered  by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810, but for now it can enjoy the first  mover's advantage as we can't compare the two processors yet.
Benchmark  scores were some of the highest we've ever seen - the AnTuTu score of  67,975 was significantly higher than our previous record, 52,686 set by  the Motorola Moto Turbo. Quadrant returned 34,417 points overall. Both  scores are significantly better than the Galaxy S5 managed to achieve.
Even  more interestingly, GFXBench ran at 39fps and 3DMark's Ice Storm  Unlimited test achieved 21,878 points. That means despite the  pixel-dense screen, there's more than enough graphics horsepower to let  you run today's most demanding games at adequate frame rates. Video  playback performance is just fine, and even the speaker is crisp and  clear despite being shoved into such a slim body.
The battery  lasted 13 hours, 8 minutes in our standard video loop test. This should  easily translate to a full day of heavy usage, including cellular data  and games. The phone also charges very quickly, which is a feature  everyone can appreciate.
Verdict
We mostly approve of  Samsung's new direction. The company has clearly identified why the  Galaxy S5 didn't look so great against its competitors, and has taken  steps to rectify every problem. The Galaxy S6 is perfectly in line with  what we expect a 2015 flagship phone to be. It isn't perfect, but  there's seemingly a workaround for every problem: a 128GB version for  those who need storage space; downloadable components for features that  were dropped; slick features that don't make the software feel  excessive.
The Galaxy S6 is still a little bland in terms of  style, but at least it doesn't feel like an ugly toy. Only the camera  bulge is a real problem, though for the quality we're getting, we can  live with it. You'll want a protective case anyway, which will somewhat  tone down the bulge.
If you're in the market for a top-end Android  phone with a reasonably sized screen and cost is not a limiting factor,  there's really nothing to beat the Galaxy S6 at this moment. If you can  hold on for a little while, we'd suggest waiting till HTC , LG and  possibly Sony launch their own competitors. If style is more important  than anything else, the Galaxy S6 Edge has all the same features and  advantages.
Also worth noting, the Galaxy S5 has dropped to  nearly half of its launch price and is just a year old. Flagships don't  age in terms of specifications and capabilities, and so the S5 is a  viable alternative. If you want an Android experience that's closer to  stock, you could also consider the Motorola Moto Turbo ( Review | Pictures ).

"100",100,"PM Modi Heads to Silicon Valley Chasing a Digital Dream
Agence France-Presse , 24 September 2015
He has 30 million fans on Facebook and tweets multiple times a day  but as Narendra Modi visits Silicon Valley this weekend, it is Indian  technology that will be centre-screen.
India's social  media-addicted prime minister is looking to tap investors' pockets on  the trip and win support from the Valley giants to burnish his Digital  India campaign.
""India is emerging as a hub of start-ups in a wide  range of areas and we aspire to take this further,"" Modi wrote on  Facebook . ""We want the world to see our innovation capabilities in the  start-up sector.""
America's technology titans have rolled out the  welcome mat, with meetings at Apple , Facebook , green carmaker Tesla and Google , while leading Indian entrepreneurs will present themselves to  investors.
Modi is set to fly to California after attending the UN  General Assembly in New York, where he is expected to meet US President  Barack Obama on the sidelines.
It is the first visit to the West  Coast by an Indian PM since 1982 - two years before the Apple Macintosh  went on sale - and comes at a bright moment for homegrown talent, with  India-born CEOs running Microsoft , Google and Adobe .
Feverish  speculation has hit the domestic press over possible announcements, with  some suggesting Modi may seek a deal for Tesla's solar batteries as  part of a renewable energy plan to ease power shortages.
""Modi  seems to understand the role that technology can play in solving India's  problems,"" Vivek Wadhwa, a Stanford University fellow and technology  entrepreneur told AFP.
""What better way to accelerate the progress  than to build strong ties with the technology capital of the world:  Silicon Valley?"" he said.
Digital India?
India is  simultaneously a technology leader and laggard, with the world's fastest  growing start-up scene, according to software industry body Nasscom ,  and armies of highly skilled IT workers in southern Hyderabad and  Bangalore.
It also has almost a billion citizens still not online,  many in impoverished rural areas, posing an opportunity and a huge  challenge for the government and companies.
Hi-tech fan Modi has  appeared at rallies in hologram form, has his own smartphone app and in  March implored IT industry leaders to ask why India had not produced a  Google.
Yet his technological fervour has made little dent in the  country's paper-heavy bureaucracy, with GE leader Jeffrey Immelt this  week lamenting that it requires ""17 stamps on each document officially in the digital age"".
The government has repeatedly bungled its  handling of IT regulation, this week backtracking swiftly on a draft  encryption policy that sought to monitor emails or private chats on WhatsApp after an outcry. Last month it overturned a ban on 857 porn  sites after widespread ridicule.
""It is too early to judge (the  progress of Digital India). So far it's largely hype and wishful  thinking,"" Stanford's Wadhwa said.
Technology firms have also  suffered problems, with Google under investigation by India's  competition regulator and a Facebook project, Internet.org , criticised  for only allowing selective web access.
In addition, about 70  percent of Indian Internet users get online via a smartphone, many on  sluggish 2G connections, creating a unique challenge.
""Silicon Valley had better adapt and innovate for that market or lose,"" an insider at one major US technology company said.
'Investment flowing'
US  investors have paid relatively scant attention to Indian startups in  the past, but entrepreneurs on the ground say this is changing.
""Since  the prime minister has taken over there's already a lot more investment  that has been flowing into the country,"" said Prukalpa Sankar,  co-founder of SocialCops, which uses data to tackle social problems.
