PROS: 1) Display is pretty good with vibrant colors. 2) Touch is smooth and responsive. 3) Build quality is good and look of this phone in gold color is great. 4) Camera quality is simply Brilliant(Both front and rear) 5) Battery backup is goodas you expect from 3000maH battery. 6)No lag or hanging problem as of now and you shounld not expect hanging problem with 1.5GB of RAM and Octacore processor. 7)Slim and Light Weight. 8) Front Flash 9) OTG support. 10)Fast Charging. CONS: 1) No backlit on buttons. 2) No Gorilla Glass(Tempered glass may be applied to solve this issue) 3) Speaker sound is little less as compared to other phones at this price.  Overall a good phone I am so impressed with this phone that I even ordered one more..;) PS: Go for GOLD.Look of Gold color is just unbeatable.For me this phone edges over moto g 3rd gen because of looks and bigger screen size as all other features of both phones are same so if you are looking for 5.5; screen phone this is for you.Will update my review after 30 days of usage.    
This is my personal experience using J7 for 3 days. I waited a long time for this phone for more than 1 month. As someone said, Don't judge the book by it's cover same concept is here.  I am using this phone for last few days ; i found nothing great in it b'coz i am already using samsung G Grand. As mentioned, i will try to figure it out.. This product is manufactured by samsung but in India..  Pros+Cons:  1) This phone is just the replica of previous ones in terms of design but its sleek ; golden one is available for such price segment, that's something different from samsung.  2) Around the globe samsung is famous for ;Hanging; issue, this time they worked hard to overcome this, still i am facing slow processing(not hanging) with some apps.  3)Battery drainage was biggest drawback for samsung ; still it is. Just the drainage is slow this time. The Ultra power saving mode is something Rubbish. Only black screen with some apps to use. Limiting usage will easily save battery, what's new in that?  4)Display is always one of the best part in samsung ; it is. I tried BluRay print of AVATAR, I must say here Super AMOLED failed, but except that display is best. Brightness is better. In outdoor condition its fine. Reduced security here with gorilla glass.  5)Performance is Ok-Ok. No lags till now. But samsung phones performance decreases with time.  6)Camera: The 13MP rear camera with f1.9 aperture, its not the one to be called Samsung's camera. Its something else. Outdoor clicks are always good with any camera, problem is with indoor clicks. What we got in this phone will always take same picture as samsung never provide any update to their phones in their lifetime. Pictures are really not even comparable to Moto G 3rd Edtn OR ASUS Zenfone 2.  5MP front camera, is worst you can get. Even samsung J1 front camera with 2MP is better than this one! Unbelievable. The front flash is just an add on, night pics with this flash were Horrible.  7) I don't find any issues related to connectivity, just the second sim signals are fluctuating, here you'll get both LTE SIM Slot. PC connectivity is easy.  8)For user, 11.6GB of memory is available to use. I used 64GB SD card ; it is running smoothly.  9)Sound may be a concern for other brand lovers as sound is little low. Traditional stereo headset neither great nor too bad. Some R;D work added with samsung J7, to understand what level of sound a user experience ; adapt it accordingly.  10)Multimedia: This phone does not understand .avi format related to video ; movie. No dedicated music player, Google play music is available.  11)Phone is little bit heavy ; sleek its not easy to keep. I am using Samsung flip cover which is great in looks, quality ; grab.  12)Someone mentioned here that this phone does not capture screenshot, Well it does. Menu button+Power button for 1sec will capture.  13)Many functions of android like Widgets n all are not available, that leads to less customization which we don't like.  14)The Gold variant is awesome in looks, but biggest drawback is the back panel. It's a thin paper size plastic panel one can easily break it. The CHEAPEST item in J7.  15)Touch panel is as usual great. Smooth-utterly-butterly experience but sometimes single touch doesn't work. Same problem claimed by other users also.  16)In-built apps like Smart Manager is great with security app. SKYPE,One Drive/Note, useful, but games which are pre-installed, seriously one will ask who play this Shit? also only 180 minutes are provided to play.  17)RAM management is always hectic work for samsung, again poor management of RAM. One gets only 500 Mb. Which is just 35% of overall capacity whereas in Moto G 3rd, one gets 1.2Gb of RAM ~ 60%. Due to this i think am facing slow processing of some apps.  18) No backlit on buttons.  About AnTuTu Benchmark:  1) It scored 36485(Quite bettr than Moto G 3rd). On benchmarks J7 won, but in reality Moto G works better.  Overall for this phone, samsung has been reduced everything up-to an extent to satisfy only Indian needs ; keeping it under 15k range, as in this price they compromised, Gorilla glass, Better camera, More RAM, Exynos processor insted of Qualcomm Snapdragon, Metal back panel, Menu functioning(reduced android facility). I don't think this is what I needed.  I am not satisfied with this as i already enjoy better experience than this. Nothing's new ; incredible, i must say one should prefer Moto G 3rd Edtn, as it is less expensive ; provides Gorilla glass, stock android, better Ram management, IPX7-rating water resistant, ; better camera. Only Gold colour ; 5.5 screen is not the only thing one should go for. Hope that helps.     
I have placed the order on 28th Aug and got the mobile on 31st Aug. I am fully satisfied with this mobile. Previously i felt that Samsung mobiles are hanging and dead slow. But after using this mobile, i am changing my decision. This mobile performance is smooth and Awesome. I have installed Asphalt 8 of 1.5GB size. But it is working even with out a small blink. Front flash is Awesome and picture quality is too good. Battery is very nice. It remains to 3-4 hours even we are continuously playing games. I am fully satisfied with my mobile and its reasonable cost.    
I got Samsung j7 from flipkart on 23rd sep and here is my genuine review after 10 days of use. I change my phone max every 6 months previously used Honor 4x, lenovo k3 note, lenovo a7000, mi4, samsung s5, iphone 6, samsung note 3 neo, one plus one, moto g3  Look and feel: 10/10 for gold version I have gold varient and build quality is nice, though its plastic i am ok with it. i have a golden transparent cover and trust me i have fooled my friends and family saying that its Note 5. so far the best looking phone i have used.  Software: 10/10  As it is Android 5.1.1 the user experience is ery smooth, no lag and feature rich. though the Ram is 1.5gb this phone is blazing fast and beats all of the above mention phones. its DDR3 ram and optimized with samsungs Eynos processor. Good job done   Sensors: 7/10  People talk a lot a out sensors, really! do u evn know wht all these sensors do, no u dnt. well yes you dnt have auto bright sensor and i am ok with tht as it has outdoor mode and in daylight if you click tht it is bery bisible and bright.. it has all sensors you need for basic functions, nothing extra but it wont bother you.  Gaming: 9/10 It am a games and i play games like nova 3, 8 ball pool, mc4, asphalt, nfs mw, blits brigade and ii havnt noticed any major lag and device dsnt abnormally heat up. so good gaming device.  Video and Sound: 7/10 Yes it is not one of the loudest phone you can buy in market, if you want that go for Sony or Htc. loudness is enough for watching videos on youtube and listening music, if you feel your ring tone volume is less install free apps like speaker booster and keep limit to 40% and use 320kbps songs as your ringtones.. trust me loudness is enough, it is samsung and is comparable with samsung s5. clarity is decent enough.   No led : 7/10 Yes i miss tled notification feature a lot, but guess what you are using Android there are 100 alternatives for missing led notification light. try app called dynamic notification, it has inbuld feature under accessibility to use camera flash light when u get a call and it has inbuilt reminder for notification...u can choose frm notification tones, vibration and time. so i dnt crib abt it. i am happy and contented about it.  Camera: 8/10  people expect dslr pictures from their phone, no it will not happen... 13 mp back camera is very good in day light and low light.. it is close to samsung s5 and one plus one... better than rest in this price category. front 5mp cam with flash is the highlight and people will come and ask you which phone is this. both front and back cameras are very good.   Battery: 9/10 I feel i am back in time when i was using Nokia phones, yes the battery is that good in samsung j7. with very heavy usage like me it gives me 1 day backup and still have 20% juice left. moderate user can expect 1.5 to 2 days easily.   Verdict: 8/10 15k, this phone is worth the money, it is samsung and new touchwiz is very smooth and lag free. Exceptionally good battery, good camera, good gaming without lag and decent sound output. i have used a lot of phones and in this price range the quality provided by samsung is good. amoled screen is best, have options for changing the look n feel of device with samsung themes. rather than buying any chinese brand go for this phone you wont regret.     
Thanks for Flipkart delivery. Got phone within 22 hrs.  I bought Gold variant.  Return bank to Samsung after using Xiomi Redmi and Yureka.And feel Brand is brand. After using phone for 1 day I am writing this review of the phone.  Pros. 1. Phone display is awesome as mention Super AMOLED screen. 2. Operate very fast. Do multitasking smoothly. 3. Till now no heating issue. 4. Yes, OTG support, I connect my OTG pen drive. Connect and wait for 3-4 sec it will auto display your data. 5. Out of 16 GB 11.5 GB available for user.  6. 470 to 550 MB ram available for Use. 7. Touch is smooth.  8. Headphone average as compared Yureka. 9. Slim and light weight. 10. Fit in your hand.  11. Comes with preppy screen guard and back guard but not for long use.  12. Got Airtal sim free. 13. Preinstalled Google apps and Gameloft’s games.  Cons. 1. No gorilla glass display. (Apply tempered glass will solve issue). 2. It should 2 GB RAM.    
Hi All,  I am writing this review after a month usage. All I can say, It's is a nice mobile. It has met all my expectations. Only few points to mention...  1. Ph. Volume is very low.. Sumsung guys , pls do something to fix this.. 2. .Since you might miss a call as ph vol. is low, you will probabily miss any notification as there is no any notification light.  Otherwise it is a good one to go for...One suggestion.. if you are planning, Pls go for Gold colour as it looks awesome. All the best!!    
I had ordered for Samsung Galaxy J7 on 26th Aug 1 PM and I received the phone by 27th Aug 12 PM. As always, Flipkart did the task perfectly. Product was delivered in less than a day.  Here I am listing down pros and cons that I could observe after a day's usage   Pros :-  1. Thickness of the phone is highly commendable.  2. Finish of the phone is nice. Steel edges give the phone a rich look.  3. Touch is very smooth.  4. Display is very good because of Super AMOLED screen.  5. Battery got drained by just 20% with WiFi connection on all the time and after browsing the features of the phone intensively. 6. Front flash is useful. 7. Battery didn't get heated up while charging or during usage. 8. No issues with WiFi connectivity.  Cons:-  1. Ambient light sensor is absent. This makes the life difficult when we intend to see the caller while we are outdoors.  2. Speaker sound is less as speakers are placed behind the phone.  3. Absence of notification light. This can be compensated by using the apps like NoLED etc., 4. Camera can be improved. Auto-focus by lens takes a little more time when compared to cameras in other latest phones. Colors captured by the camera are not close to exact.  5. We don't get a great feel of Android Lollipop as the OS appears similar to older Android versions. No special UI (Like we have ZenUI in Asus or EMUI in Honor) is available in this phone.  6. Gorilla glass is missing.  Overall, it's a good phone from a brand like Samsung with an Octa-core processor and sleek design.    
I ordered this phone yesterday and today its in my hand. This Gold version is awesome in looks.  Why you should buy this phone?  1) For best camera and looks 2) unbeatable gaming experience. 3) Screen display is amazingly awesome.  4) 1.5 GB of RAM makes it more faster than others (I have used Asus 2 GB but J7 is far better than that). 5) OTG support. 6) Front cam with flash. 7) Very good battery backup.  Why you should not buy?  1) Sound is little low. I will give 7/10 2) No back-lit. 3) No Gorilla Glass.     
the mobile received was in good condition. thanks to flip-kart for the speedy delivery. Camera quality is superb 13 mp rear and 5mp front both are excellent. Battery backup is also good. Checked the IMEI number which is in box with the code, both are same. no connectivity issues when i connected it to PC.    
after past 2-3 months of research,and going through countless reviews about all other potential candidates i finally decided to lock my choice on this.i am not going to go point by point about the specifications as it is already there for your reference. let me tell you what i felt after my hands on experience . you guys have to admit samsung has lost its sheen due to crappy interface and monotonic design,and frequent HANGING issues which will make you slap any one who even suggests you to buy one.   OK ,this majestic beast is nothing like its predecessors which has premium looks,feather touch sensitivity,and zero lagging issues that will leave you speechless..seriously and i have the gold variant,which is a head turner . innovative processor matched with 1.5 ram and mali 720 graphics gives you the desired result,played high end games like asphalt 8,nova 3 seamlessly for 45 minutes ,and no heating issues at all . 5.5 inch screen with super amoled(less ppi has no effect ) screen gives the best movie watching experience. camera is awesome (both front and rear) ,and sound quality is superb(sound alive + ,and tube amp effect doing their magic). battery backup is perhaps one of its main usp. 3000 mah battery easily gives you around 2 days of back up(after 45 minutes game play+3 hour of wifi, 5 hour of movie,5 hour of song ,and occasional call and message handling).with a unique feature of ultra power saving) all this for 15k ,from samsung!!.  to sum it up in a line- grab it .......     
I purchased Samsung J7 to gift my wife on her birthday. When she switched on this phone was unable to unlock, i thought i will restart and it will work. But after removing screen guard , factory reset phone but problem still persist. We have to restart by clicking on power and volume button to restart the phone everytime touch dont work. We requested flipkart to return this phone and give us replacement. They called once asked us to factory reset ; remove screen guard, we did all they said and flipkart rep said he will call back in sometime. But we never received any call from him. We missed one call and they rejected the replacement. I am trying returning the phone but still they are rejecting my request. Now we are thinking to report this incident to consumer court for this pathetic service and bad quality phone. I will not recommend to buy this phone to anyone. Its not worth the money.    
Believe in the brand. You will get full satisfaction along with with full specification.! Why J7? 1) Phone is slim and great in shape. 2) Camera quality is outstanding. Both front and back. Even in night you will be able to click outdoor selfie without any gains. 3) Phone display is awesome. If you want to revel the greatness of Super Amoled display, just go n buy and give a treat to your eye. 4) The golden colored set gives a elite look. 5) No heating issue and fast charging. 6) An absolute gaming console along with superb display without any lag. 7) Some have some issue on about the RAM of J7, nut trust me, RAM of 1.5 GB is absolutely optimized with OCTA CORE processor.  Only Loop holes of the Phone is Sound, not the sound clarity but the sound volume.     
This Phone is Awesome. In 15k this is perfect phone with Brand. Nice Features like : -  1) Camera quality is simply Brilliant(Both front and rear) 2) No hanging problem  3) Touch is smooth. 4) Build quality is good and look of this phone in gold color is great. 5) Display is pretty good. 6) Battery backup is good. 7)Slim and Light Weight. 8) OTG support.  Overall a good phone I am so impressed with this phone and Also would like to thanks Flipkart for fast delivery of the phone.      
this phone does not has some basic features that you can have in 5-6 k mobile.  No notification led. no physical button back-lit. no auto brightness function. no charging led. back cover is too thin that can break even in just bend.  overall, not happy.    
Friends,  Sharing My Experience of J7 here... It is a good deal at this price...  well, about phone after a week of use.  Very Good :  1.Off Golg slim, looks pretty and gives a pinch of luxury...  2.Battery depletion is nicely managed with different power saving modes.(3000 mAh) 3.Both the Cameras are Good.... (But, Dual Led could be litter better for low light distance snaps) 4.Super Amoled display makes playing of HD Video/Pics/Games Simply Amazing. 5.Games run smoothly. 6.No such heating issue till... 7.net browsing is good with 5.5 inch screen. 8.OTG support is helpful 9.RAM(1.5 GB- its ok) and Processor are good very much compatible and makes the device faster. 10.Supports graphics to a very good extent for very high resolution games. 11. ear piece is good and voice is very clear. 12. Antena to trace signal is too good. 13. 128 gb storage option is good and 16 gb internal hels you a lot for smooth phone operation. 14. good quality built-materials. ...etc.  Not Good:  1. Volume of Audio is Less in output speaker, though clarity is good.  My Score 4.5/5  comment : Go 4 it !!!! -- @rp Technical Analyst      
What other options you need in a Mid-Range Phone:  Display: The S-AMOLED. (If you don't know about FYI it's the Best killer for Phones)  Cam: 13MP (Remember f/1.9) ; 5MP with front ; rear LEDs.(which means lots more light can enter to drive down the processing necessary and, in turn, deliver a cleaner resulting image with less interfering image noise.)  Processor: Exynos Octa core1.5 GHz (No Qualcomm No Heat..)  If you want to know more there are still lot pros for you like 3000mAh, Dual sim both compatible for 4g, 16Gigs internal, 128 GB Extendable, Beatiful TouchWiz UI,  Cons: 1.5GB Ram (Can ignore we've a powerful processor to manage), Censors(Really..??) My options were MI4, Moto G3 (Please don't mention Lenovo, htc coz i'm talking seriously), I bought after nearly 30 days research, around 500 sites I had gone through for research. Trust me you will never regret.. After all it''s SAMSUNG.    
It was a long wait. Phone is good, with few drawbacks. But have to mentioned, i am disappointed with the ringtone volume.  Pros: 1 Nice classy looks 2 Works very smoothly 3 Camera is good. 4 Picture colour production is superb.-(had taken indoor pic, turn out to be very good) 5. When busy can cancel the call by sending busy msg. 6. Internet speed is good. Very smooth working. 7. Charges quickly and stays long.   Cons 1. Ringtone volume is too low, at high setting. Even at room level its too low.Look like Samsung forgot to put the speakers.  2. Notification light is missing. But its fine, i do not want my phone to flash light at night, it can be disturbing. But low ringtone volume, with no notification light is issue.  3. Camera is Out of the body. Like when you will keep the phone down the camera will be first to touch the surface. So can easily get damage. Well they have given metal frame around the camera but not sure if effective.  Giving 4 star because i believe phone should able to perform basic function effectively.    
Hi guys,   I bought this phone samsung j7 from flipkart. Delivered today but as soon as i recieved i was going on with the general checks we do like sound, screen quality and many simple checks, then i realized the sound quality is good but the sound is not at all loud i am very much disappointed by the output.I was out with friends , one of my friends called on the device i was not at all alerted as the sound is too much low. Please friends dont buy this device at all because samsung should know that if we miss calls on our mobiles so whats the use of mobiles we buy. Samsung please fix this. Overall phone is very good but just because of the low sound this whole product is useless. Its totally bad as its titles gaming phone its not at all one because gaming phone should also have a good sound output. Its my advice dont go for it...thank you

Edit: After 1 week of use, this phone is getting heated every time i charge it even the screen is getting heated so that you ll not love to touch.  This is my personal experience using J7 for 7 days. I waited a long time for this phone for more than 1 month. As someone said, Don't judge the book by it's cover same concept is here.  I am using this phone for last few days ; i found nothing great in it b'coz i am already using samsung G Grand. As mentioned, i will try to figure it out..

Limiting usage will easily save battery, what's new in that?  4)Display is always one of the best part in samsung ; it is. I tried BluRay print of AVATAR, I must say here Super AMOLED failed, but except that display is best. Brightness is better. In outdoor condition its fine. Reduced security here with gorilla glass.  5)Performance is Ok-Ok. No lags till now. But samsung phones performance decreases with time.  6)Camera: The 13MP rear camera with f1.9 aperture, its not the one to be called Samsung's camera. Its something else.

Only Gold colour ; 5.5 screen is not the only thing one should go for.  Hope that helps.

I bought J7 on 23rd Aug,  Good phone for 15k,   except below, remains OK  NO LED notification , short charger cable,      
Superb phone for 15k, Go for it... Speaker is the drawback (very low), got back all my contacts from Icloud.    
I was waiting for the phone since July. Got it delivered today. So hand on review: 1. Phone weight is not on light side. It's little bulky. Also looks is not attractive in any manner. Backside has branding of 'samsung' in middle and '4G Duos' at lower side.  2. Screen is quite good with great viewing angles and brightness. But no auto brightness available. So has to manually adjust it.   3. Till now no hanging issue. Played few games for test only. Opened multiple apps at time and phone handles good till now.  4. Camera is good. You can't complain about it. Great in its segment.  5. Speaker volume is ok. Not loud not much low. But little high could be better.  6. Touch is less responsive. I have to touch screen twice some times to work. Not happy with it at all.  7. Physical keys are not backlit just like Chinese stuff. Also headphones are not of good quality.  Overall experience is not good. I used so many samsung, Sony, apple, Asus, Lenovo, mi and other brand. So for this price range and considering its samsung this is 4k more expensive for its overall all performance. 11k would be a good deal. As other Chinese brands are giving that stuff in 6.5k to 8k.    
this phone does not has some basic features that you can have in 5-6 k mobile.  No notification led. no physical button back-lit. no auto brightness function. no charging led. back cover is too thin that can break even in just bend.  overall, not happy.    
I'm trying to write at fullest with hands experience on handset and may help you. After all - final call is yours .....  Probably Many are given 5 or 4 Stars.... If you compare price 15k  it is waste ..... 1. There is no multi window 2. There is no side bar 3. RAM is not that appreciable  H/W 1. Low quality ear phone 2. Low quality speakers 3. Charge wire length (could have given more length) 3. Display Resolution - instead of HD it should have been fullHD.  4. Back Cover - i felt low quality.  After all - it is your money ... choice is yours. if your biased by brand then purchase it. otherwise checkout best available phones in market - Microsoft -640XL 4G Variant, Moto G - 4G and LG etc..... in same range of 15k.  For positive feedback see who have given 5(*)....  Further i'll write usage feedback after hands on the mobile set. ...  After 1 Week: - Offers (3)(4) that displayed or offered is WASTE .... do not go by this. - Camera - When you take picture and view it then press back ;TOO MUCH LAG to SWITCH or get ready; - this is irritating. means slow. - I tried google camera - QUALITY is too bad when i used 3rd party APP.... -SOUND : Rear (Speaker) and Front (Ear Piece) are not that good compared to Old SAMSUNG S series., I had problem with sound switching or i don't what it is called - i.e when i played songs/vedio in VLC, MX , Google and Musix Player sound coming out of Front (Ear Piece), i decided to that fault handset but i tried to fix it up by restarting phone - it worked fine - after restarting normal sound through Rear (Speaker). ---------------------- So far good is that is phone is not heating up. ----------------- Further i'll write review after playing games in the handset.....     
I am giving this review after using this device after 6 days   and I would recommend to all don't go with device for budget purposely reasons r   1. Sound of Ringtones and Notification r very Low even Ur in silent room u can find very difficult to here Incoming calls and messages so, don't think at all for outdoor utilize this device   2. Its said that it is gaming device but I have fond HEATING issue in very small amt of time and games r like Dr.driving and Wcc cricket  3. Camera quality is average I have found more noise in device, some time it gives u good pic... for selfie camera it makes pic noisy... with flash u find ur face is gatting blurish and no grains at all for realistic look    I would say better to go with E7 for camera purpose even not think for galasy A7 as  per my view    lastly I want tell the features for Samsung lovers  1. Graphically games r very rich looks like royal but Just I have mentioned early Heating issue can make u disappoint   2. Processor is very nice so u can manage Ur work fastly and smoothly   but in average it is not worth for buying this phone at 15 k     
well, about phone after ONE MONTH of use.  Very Good :  1.Off Golg slim, looks pretty and gives a pinch of luxury...  2.Battery depletion is nicely managed with different power saving modes.(3000 mAh) and battery back up also exelent 3.Both the Cameras are Good.... (But, Dual Led could be litter better for low light distance snaps) 4.Super Amoled display makes playing of HD Video/Pics/Games Simply Amazing. 5.Games run smoothly. 6.No such heating issue till... 7.net browsing is good with 5.5 inch screen. 8.OTG support is helpful 9.RAM(1.5 GB- its ok) and Processor are good very much compatible and makes the device faster. 10.Supports graphics to a very good extent for very high resolution games. 11. ear piece is good and voice is very clear. 12. Antena to trace signal is too good. 13. 128 gb storage option is good and 16 gb internal hels you a lot for smooth phone operation. 14. good quality built-materials. .15..speedycharging with 1.55 A USB charger    
This Phone is Simply Awesome.If you are looking to buy phone under 15k this is perfect phone.First to review certified buyer  Great Phone I love samsung. I hv previously galaxy s duos. I ordered J7 on 21.08.15 recd on 22.08.15 by flipkart. First thanks to flipkart for speedy delivery..... good service. Best phone by Samsung for the 15K with 4G ; 16 GB storage 1. Phone is slim and light weight 2. Display is fine. No hanging problems. 3. Camera quality is superb. 4. Battery backup is also good. 5. Awesome performance 6. Charging is too fast 7. Front flash    
in maruti budget, i got Ferrari!!   sexy looks!! audio video quality is clear!! battery backup is too good!!. at budget phone!!    
Very good mobile in the recent times at economical price. All features are up to the mark, and the phone holds a thumbs up. Selfies are captured with auto beautification and flash adds value. Signal strength and application processing speed are not compromised. Obviously its built up quality, color combinations, power packed system at this price range is a tough competitor in the market. Design of the phone is same as galaxy variants, which I wished would have been changed.  ~SRK    
FOR THOSE WHO WANT GOOD CAMERA SHOULD NOT BUY THIS  AND THE BAD THING IS THAT THIS DEVICE HAVE FRONT FACING FLASH , THEY COULD IMPROVE THE CAMERA QUALITY INSTEAD OF THIS  I THING NOBODY WANT FRONT FACING FLASH  ALL OTHER THINGS ARE GOOD AS THEY MENTION GOOD PROCESSING SPEED AND VERY GOOD EXCEPT CAMERA    
Awesome Phone This Phone is Simply Awesome.If you are looking to buy phone under 15k this is perfect phone. PROS: 1) Display is pretty good with vibrant colors. 2) Touch is smooth and responsive. 3) Build quality is good and look of this phone in gold color is great. 4) Camera quality is simply Brilliant(Both front and rear) 5) Battery backup is goodas you expect from 3000maH battery. 6)No lag or hanging problem as of now and you shounld not expect hanging problem with 1.5GB of RAM and Octacore processor. 7)Slim and Light Weight. 8) Front Flash 9) OTG support. 10)Fast Charging. CONS: 1) No backlit on buttons. 2) No Gorilla Glass(Tempered glass may be applied to solve this issue) 3) Speaker sound is little less as compared to other phones at this price.  Overall a good phone I am so impressed with this phone that I even ordered one more..;) PS: Go for GOLD.Look of Gold color is just unbeatable.For me this phone edges over moto g 3rd gen because of looks and bigger screen size as all other features of both phones are same so if you are looking for 5.5; screen phone this is for you.Will update my review after 30 days of usage. (Collapse)    
Must say that the delivery system of flipkart is appreciable; got the device 6 days before the due date... 1. The Handset and its gold colour (which I ordered) look sleek. 2. The clock icon of the touchwiz ui doesn't work live properly. 3. Preinstalled games couldn't be uninstalled, can only be disabled. 4. New Know mode provide good security and efficiend management. 5. The front flash is previlige with this device. 6. No lag or glitch till now. 7. Unfortunately Samsung include bulk bloatware, which cannot be removed. 8. Battery capacity is good. 9. Volume is quite low on device. 10. Lacks sensors such as ambient light sensor, compass etc. 11. I would personally give 8/10, if you wish to spend money on a quality flagship like Samsung this is the best device at this range, else you could go for other brands.    
phone is awesome.I have used this phone last 5 days.Dual camera is god. picture quality is super.Many people told me that Octa Core processor means Heating problem.But this phone have no heating problem.Every thing work super first and Big game run without hang,Like-Nova 3,Batman,Real footbal 2015,Contract killer 2,D-Day commando and much more.Charging is very fast and touch is awesome.Yes,4g mobile and Otg cable support.    
I received this phone (Gold Color) 4 days back .. The experience with this phone has been quite satisfying til now with no problems at all..   Pros:  1) Build quality is good . Huge screen , still lightweight. Gold color looks good. 2) Both cameras are good . Front flash is a plus. 3) Battery Backup is good ..lasts upto full 1 -1.5 days based on usage. 4) No heating issues while charging. No lags while playing games. 5) Many people are complaining about the ringtone sound. Its hardly 10% less of the usual phone . Not Bad. Able to hear the ringtones from other room.  Cons: (Quite Manageable) 1) No Notification LED. 2) Back Cover seems fragile. I'm using a separate Flip cover , so not an issue for me. 3) Available RAM is less. but even after installing 25+ new apps, phone performance hasn't degraded.    
Awesome buget smartphone...@15...best phone ever god camera...games...performance...and other features    
very good mobile from samsung india, made for specially vey high demanding indian customers, very good camera, 4g, dual sim, big screen powered by S.amoled, over all very satisfactory...    
Got this phone after reading a lot of reviews. Super phone wit battery lasting for 2 days. For people complaining about low sounding ring tone install app called loud ringtones and u should be fine.    
Today is the 3rd day I am using this phone, great experience till now, I would say a great phone in such price... even though there are some cons but I will focus on Pros firs.  Great looks, speed is good, ample space of around 11 GB you get. No Heating issue as such, battery back up is good, Android 5.1 works great on this phone  Cons Very low ringtone sound Charger could have been of 2 Amp can not find anymore, but still I would say, the more I will use the phone the more will come on way....    
I ordered this product from flipkart as the item is exclusively available here. The mobile is pretty good with display and touch is feather. Accessories with the product has really disappointed me. The charging cable looks low quality and gets loose while charging. Headphones are grandfather style and is absolutely no match with the handset. Samsung has reduced the cost on this mid-range phone but have compromised on the quality of the accessory. Henceforth overall score 80/100.    
Ok, i hated Samsung but after with a bad experience with MOTO E2, I have to buy a good phone with better services.  I found Good features in this phone but still want some time to review it better because my moto shows its color after a month  so till now  Pros.... 1. Nice slim Design 2. Good cameras both rear and front. 3. Battery Backup is good. 4. Theme and other Graphics support make you feel Happy 5. 16 GB internal memory good enough and dont bother you to buy memory card 6. flesh both side is fantastic to use front camera 7. Super amold Screen is good enough  Cons 1. 1.5 gb ram 2. sound is not as good as needs to be 3. only one sim can be work as 4G 4. Lock phone for indian region only 5. no auto brightness  till now what i feel good phone. enough qualities to buy in 15K range    
samsung j 7 in 15000/- is very good phone  the camera of the phone is good .... 13 mp back nd 5 mp with flsh... and the look wise the phone is very good .... slim and nice  go for golden colour .....    
who say the j7 is not good phone for who say that....!!!!! 1) Phone is slim and great in shape. 2) Camera quality is outstanding. Both front and back. Even in night you will be able to click outdoor selfie without any gains. 3) Phone display is awesome. If you want to revel the greatness of Super Amoled display, just go n buy and give a treat to your eye. 4) The golden colored set gives a elite look. 5) No heating issue and fast charging. 6) An absolute gaming console along with superb display without any lag. 7) Some have some issue on about the RAM of J7, nut trust me, RAM of 1.5 GB is absolutely optimized with OCTA CORE processor. suprb phone no pro at all    
Hey guys Sandeep here, i m using this phone and trust me its a money valuable product with extreme sAmoled display,superb touch,ultrafast processor and a immense high camera quality specially front led flash for selfie..Gold color is soo damm sexy.if u r font of selfie and gaming just Go for it,J7 is ultimate piece from Samsung.    
Yet again a great product from Samsung. I have been using this for 1 week now. Its flawless. The speaker is not that loud though. It does not meet the sound quality which is expected from phones in the range of 15k. The ringtones are not audible. Had to download ringtone from Google Play.      
everything u get is more than enough in this range.go ahead n get it without thinking... SAMSUNG REALLY SUPERB.!!!!!!!    
I received the phone a few hours back, and have found it quite satisfactory. The audio is not as a big issue at is being made out to be.  However there is a thin bright white line through 3/4 of the breadth of the screen at the bottom of the screen, which becomes prominent with a dark background such as when the phone is starting up. I also noticed that this line appears only when brightness settings is set at above 70%. I am not sure if it is a software issue or a hardware defect, but I have left a mail with the Flipkart team and hope to get a satisfactory reply.    
Hi, I got the J7 Phone. On the first day itself it started giving problem, Like the internet net wont work even if there is full network. ill have to turn of the data and turn it on. And when people tried calling me, it says the phone is out of reach or switched off even if the phone is ON ,with full network signal. I dont know if its the same problem with every one.. Kindly Advice..    
after using 20 days i am giving my opinion...it is worth to buy...under 15k it is best phone..having no issues with the phone,,,awesome camera...video quality is the best compare to anyphones under 15k...just having one issue with the sound output nd thats all u can ignore that!!!by the way i am enjoying nd having a good time with my j7...    
Hi,  I am using this phone last one week where i found superb mobile phone experience. Smooth screen touch, super fast internet access, application are running smoothly. Ear phones are not up to the mark but rest of the phone is outstanding and its GOLD colour give Elite look.  I used Samsung Grand but this phone is awesome. Before buying this phone i planned to buy Moto G2. But i have good experience with Samsung mobile phones so i goes with Samsung J7.  In one word it's Decent look phone and phone functionality in 15k range... must buy product.

THANKS ; REGDS  RAJIB SARKAR      
This is an amazing phone, using it for 2 weeks. Gold color looks very attractive and phone is very slim. Those who think that 5.5; is too big to hold, you will get used to it after a while. With super amoled display, color reproduction and viewing angles are great. Since this does not have gorilla glass, you can use tempered glass screen protector which is available within Rs. 500. Phone does not get heated much even after playing high end games like GT Racing 2 and gaming performance is magnificent with no lag even when I played Gt Racing 2 at higher graphics. There is no drop in WIFI as some users are saying and touch and apps run very smooth though the available free ram is less. Would have been a stunning deal if RAM was of 2GB. The biggest drawback in this phone is the Speaker volume which is a bit low. The battery backup is too good in this phone, i am getting around 1.6 days with 3G. Never seen such good battery backup in any other phone. Can't tell about the camera now as I have not taken much pictures in different lighting conditions, though initially I found that image becomes a bit hazy if you zoom your captured image.  Did not bought Moto G3 because J7 has better looks with bigger size, better display, 128GB expandable memory, far better battery, touchwiz ui looks good than stock android and gaming performance is great and J7 beats Moto G easily in Benchmark tests.  Giving 4 stars only because of the low speaker volume and 1.5 gb ram(please note there are no lags as of now with multiple apps running, don't know what will happen if you install tons of apps). Can't get everything in 15k :D    
Writing this after a week's usage.Camera is superb, design is great,battery is too nice,Ultra power saving mode is a magic.Speaker is good enough, touch is good,Octa core processor with 1.5 GB RAM is great.Overall a good phone. Go for it, leave those chinese motos,asus,lenovo etc . buy this great smartphone. Ordered on 27 aug and received on 3rd sep,So 3 stars for delivery and 5 stars for this great phone...    
I had Placed Order for this Product as Pre-Order on 27th July. 2015. That time showing delivery on 7-9th Aug,15 but after that Flipkart updated me to deliver by 28th Sep. 2015. I was shocked that they need 2 Months to deliver when product is available for Selling. and after several Email they Delivered me on 5th Sep. 2015.  Samsung J7 is Good Product with some Good Configuration. I had purchased because of Some Offers and it is having 16Gb Internal with Super AMOLED Display. I am Quiet Satisfied by its Performance  but Few shortcoming are there 1. Its Camera (rear 13mp) is not as much Good, I think Sony 8MP Camera is better than this. It shoots at 72dpi (not 300dpi) 2. Major shortcoming (better say Blunder) its sound is veryyyy Poor. You can not hear Rings while driving in Traffic even at Home you can Miss Important Calls. 3. Hearing Volume Quality is also Very poor you will have to put very close to your Ear to hear properly.  Samsung must work on Sound Quality and Volume.    
I bought it a couple of weeks before.  Many are complaining about short cable. But I never seen such a faster charging.  Display is like FHD eventhough its 720p  Audio Quality via headphones are mindblowing, (i am using seinnheiser cx275s). I suggest you to buy a branded one instead of the cheap headphones provided along with the handset.  Fast Processing without lags. (till date)  Premium look with the gold color.  Both the camera are decent for the price range.  missing the tap to wake option, led notifications.  Over all its a good deal and a worth buying.   Better than Moto G3    
I have purchased this Samsung Galaxy J7 a week ago. Delivery was quick as I opted for ;Same Day Delivery;.  Pros:  1. First brand product (i.e. Samsung, HTC, Apple etc are recognised as first brand and Micromax, Lava, Asus, Karbonn, Spice, Xiaomi etc are recognised as second brand).   2. Better Display than other same price range phone thanks to Samsung Super AMOLED display with On-cell Display. But this is not like other Samsung flagship phone display.  3. Battery backup is awesome. I am using two SIM, one 3G and 2nd 2G. It give me around 15-18 hours backup. I always put on the Mobile data service. Occasionally play games (30-45 Minutes). I like its standby time. Because its CPU clocked 400mhz-1.5ghz, OS can minimize the per core usage to 400mhz at standby.   4. Built in quality is at par. Its all plastic body. I like my MI 4 built quality. The chromium plastic border on my Samsung J7 look cheap when I look closer. Please take extra care when removing the back cover, it is very thin plastic.   5. Android 5.1.1 is the latest available non Nexus devices. Samsung TouchWiz some time lags on Multi tasking because of 1.5GB RAM. This phone should have 2GB RAM. On normal usage my J7 uses 50-64 % of RAM. If you I use Facebook (Non-Lite), WhatsApp, Hike and Google Chrome my phone uses 80-85 % RAM.  6. Rear camera is better than other same price range devices. I am using Asus Zenfone 2, Samsung J7 and Xiaomi MI 4i. I have seen better details on Samsung J7 at normal daylight. But when captures HDR MI 4i is much better than others. I miss Asus Zenfone 2 ;Super Resolution; on both Samsung J7 and MI 4i. Front camera is better on Mi 4i but front flash on Samsung J7 give me some advantage at backlit condition. ;Samsung j7 front flash does not flash like rear flash, its work like a front Torch;. Samsung ;Sound ; Shot; feature is quite interesting. Samsung J7 both cameras can capture 1080 Full HD video. Rear Camera have AF when shooting video. Samsung J7 does not have HDR video recording mode which is present in MI 4i. Low light camera performance also good in Samsung J7.  Cons:  1. No light sensor. We need to adjust brightness manually.  2. No Magneto Meter / E-Compass on Samsung J7.  3. No Auto Startup Manager.  4. Slow Shutter lags on Auto flash mode. Samsung J7 takes lots of time to capture multiple shots when Flash mode is ON or Auto.  5. No default DLNA music player. I am using AllConnect and Asus AiPlayer to play on my Compuer through wifi.  6. No LED notification.  That's all, if I find any other good or bad I will post soon... Thank for reading my review and sorry for my bad English...c@    
This Samsung J7 mobile is a great,marvelous,awesome mobile,with outstanding features very much close to Samsung galaxy note's features,with again reasonable price,with fast octacore processor,super amoled resolution,fast 3G connectivity,OTG support,except 2 lacking features like no compass,low speaker volume,otherwise perfect mobile.Thanx to Samsung,and flipkart    
It has been almost 2 weeks since i am using this phone. Very good experience so far. Value for money. Pros: -Slim, nice look, superb display -Battery backup is good -smooth touch and good performance -good features  Cons: sound is bit less  Overall very good experience, I liked it. Great offers given by flipkart.     
After using this phone for 10 days, pls see below my review.   Pros: Nice build quality, looks elegant.  No lagging even while playing High end games (Asphalt 8).  No heating issues Quick Charge and long lasting battery.  Cons: Speaker volume is very low, tried all settings.  low quality head phones.  Charging wire is very short.   In short a very good phone at an affordable price.    
Samsung J7 In one word about Samsung J7 to say is “AWESOME” .I thought to review about mobile after one week usage,Here comes my review and rating about the mobile.rating gives out of 5 Design : Superb slim design,5 Camera : Not so Good for indoor shots and Outdoor Good both primary and rear,3.5 Battery : Very good, if not using wiffii and data connection it longs more than 3 days, and in wifii its stay more than data but in one word battery is Verry Good, 5 Charger : Not long cable for charging mobile but it charge fastly,2.5 Headset : Old look of Samsung mobiles handsfrees like 2004 model mobiles,2 Display : Super amoled display , 5 Ram : Good, 4 Memory : Verry Good not observed lagging,4.5 Wifii : Disconnects some times,4.5 Flash : Present for both sides Rear And Primary,5 Loud speaker : Very Bad 2 No Gorilla Glass for this mobile that’s quite Nasty My Total Rating : 4.1    
Owesome Phone as Samsung provides too much in this price tag.  I really impressed from the service of FLIP KART too.    
Super display, super touch, super speed, super camera, super look...  heating- no way.  sound - not more but decent  I can give the rate 5 out of 5.    
I purchased the J7, and got a faulty product delivered (showed only three languages, and none of them was English). Flipkart was very helpful, in replacing the product in an astonishing day. The speed at which the replacement was handled, makes Flipkart my most favourite and dependable Online retailer.   I was planning on buying Samsung A7 for my wife. Thats when Samsung announced the J5 and J7 on Flipkart. When comparing the specifications, I found the compromise in J7 was not all that bad. Infact nothing justifies the 10K difference between A7 and J7, except for the gorgeous metal finishing.   Samsung J7 Pros.  1. Vibrant screen - not the highest pixel density, but does fairly decent.  2. Battery, battery and more battery - its 3000 mAh.. is wah wah wah.. ! 3. Its very fast, although I've come to realize no Android phone will stay this fast after couple months of usage.  4. Build quality is good. And the dimensions fit the hand perfectly. 5.5; is actually perfect.  5. The phone audio quality and reception is good, and 4G is an added advantage.   Samsung J7 Cons.  1. Loudspeaker / Speaker is more than just disappointing. It may well be not present at all, but this is not a deal breaker.  2. That it is not available on the retail stores, I'm not sure how the service is going to be.   Overall, for 14,999 - it equals several players in this prize zone, and by far the best Samsung phone for this price band.    
I will say amazing phone which has all the latest features in terms of hardware or saftware.  Camera and battery is superb  No hanging problems   Display is fantastic  UI interface is very good  I will say please go with this phone, it is one of the best phone at this price     
I order the phone on 25th July and get this on 26th Aug very delay from Flipkart, i was very disappointed from WSRetail because once the phone is released (20th Aug) first they have to delivered to the pre-book customers, but they did not, they started new booking and hold the pre-booked customer. I will give zero points to WsRetail.   But the phone was very nice, for 13,999 (I got Rs.1000 refund) its awesome.   Pros 1. Crystal clear display, thanks to AMOLED display 2. Mobile data connectivity is very fast in Galaxy J7, 40 MB data can be downloaded with in 2 mins 3. Touch is very smooth 4. Multitasking is very impressive 5. Camera clarity is very good 6. Very stylish and sexy look  Cons 1. No in build Music app, need to download from Play Store 2. Head set is normal (We cant expect more in 15K phone) 3. No LED indication on charging 4. Ring tone volume is very less.    
extremely classic phone 1.very good quality camera  2.no heating problem 3.phone does not hang 4.ver thin and light weight  i liked d phone very much but i think battery dries a little fast excluding that fantastic phone can buy without any doubt    
GOOD serviced provided by the flipkart. I order the mobile at 26/8/15 at 7.30 pm and received 29/8/15 at 11,10am ,  PROS :- GREAT LOOK PROVIDED BY THE SAMSUNG J 7,  PICTURE QUALITY IS VERY GOOD, CAMERA . SECONDARY CAMERA(5 MP) GOOD, AND PRIMARY (13) VERY GOOD, PERFORMANCE VERY SMOOTH , VERY GOOD I LIKE IT SO MUCH . RAM AVAILABLE FOR USER ONLY 512 MB, LITTLE BIT LESS I THINK . PLAYING GAME , VERY NICE NO LAGE.   CONES:- LESS SOUND WITHOUT USE HEAD PHONE  BACK COVER WAS SO THIN. IT MAY BE BROKE  HEAD PHONE CHARGER WIRE IS VERY SMALL , I NOT LIKE THIS , CAMERA , FLASH IS LITTLE LATE , AFTER PRESSING THE CAPTURE BUTTON.  COMPANY MAY BE PROVIDED SOME BASIC FUNCTION IT improved the market value this is NOTIFICATION LIGHT, AUTO BRIGHTNESS, CAMERA MAY GIVE THE HDR FUNCTION AS given by other less price mobile (company) . it may increase charger wire,  OVER ALL PERFORMANCE OF THIS MOBILE IS SO GOOD , 8/10 . NICE. SERVICED PROVIDED BY THE FLIPKART IS ALSO VERY GOOD, I LIKE THIS . WELL JOB   and flipkart (under RED EXPRESS ) 4/5.      
Galaxy j7 first impression after 1 week using this phone, is very nice with gold color it looks awesome. all specs are good but .. 1) Very high in price as compare with lenevo k3 note and other brands. 2) Over heating problem. 3) Low sound quality.    
Used for 1 day, my opinion:- 1)screen:- Amoled, so no question 2)No heating issues 3)Rear camera is excellent(no stabilization sensor so do not shake phone while capturing)  4)Front camera is good. (not good if using against light compared to E7) 5)battery backup is good 6)speakers are not up to the mark(low volume) 7)Headphone of J7 and Guru1200 same (disappointing) 8) 170gm wt:- Heavy compared to samsung E7.     
Phone is really really amazing. I got it delivered in 2 days by flipkart. Here are my review- Camera- 5/5 Ram-5/5. Don't judge phone by its RAM. This phone is using awesome RAM management. You will feel like you are using 3GB RAM. Screen- 5/5 Processor-5/5 Battery-5/5. long lasting battery. You will feel like you are using 5000 mah battery.   So judge a phone by quality but not quantity. Many phones will give you more feature, but those features may not be too much optimized which are optimized in this phone. Thanks!    
The phone is really cool and looks goods the touch, processor, camera, are really good but the Speaker is really bad. You can't even listen your phone is ring and No led   The biggest problem is bad speaker if they give best speaker than phone will be really best..     
Value for Money and hence an excellent mobile. But the charger cable is very short, the FM voice is not so good and lot of noices come. The back cover is very very thin    
after using it now for few days.. i have noticed that multi-tasking for the phone is quite good.. but at times it shows the message that play store just stopped working and all... i guess this is the RAM's issue.. as free space of RAM available is low i.e 500-550 mb ... but re-opening the app will solve this issue. thank god till now i did'nt face any heating problem and the processor EXYNOS 7580 .. it has made this phone better. and if you want to ask me about its camera. it is best in its segment..  Overall phone is worth buying and lets hope in the long run..this Samsung phone does not show its true Samsung colors (i.e Hanging problem and all) :D :P One thing.. which is actually missing on this phone is Notification LED and Samsung could have provided Cylindrical headphones :/ but never mind.. This phone with this price tag.. and this GOLD color...is worth investing your pocket in :) Go for it guys if anyone is in dilemma whether he/she should buy this phone or not :)    
Samsung galaxy j7 is one of the great phone like another high range phone but it give all features as high price phone...... but its mid range........ so nice phone as per my view if you willing to low range phone by high features then pls go with this phone....................    
After a long wait received the phone , The phone feature are nice except   1. External Speaker sound ,its too bad .  2. Dimensions are bit high , due to key panel in bottom . 3. ; worst part is the charging cable ,its too short .  May be Samsung will take care in future models .        
hell problem with calling and voice issues.there is no clarity and call connection is worst.problem with the all google applications specially with google drive and playstore.downloading problems with play store

Phone is super sexy,Camera is too good both front and back... The bad thing is no led notifications and no auto brightness... And the phone is superb,more than expectations...inbuild applications are awesome...plzzz buy this phone my frnds....Go for this phone... Thanx flipkart....    
J7 is very poor quiality body its not have real super amoled , just a standard vga display totally fake phone launched by samsung    
i received phone yesterday and i dont think camera is 13 mp and 5 mp.both front and rear camera are not at all good.the face colour in the photo is so ugly..felt very bad this product and after seeing the camera condition i dont want to touch that phone....this product is not for selfie lovers:) and i am so ashamed to show this mobile to my friends..    
The phone booting is very good. Camera is fine Some body put in their review sound is very less. but sound is good for me     
The sound quality of J7 is pathetic. Cant hear the phone ringing even when sitting besides it. Not a quality product, cheap materials used.    
I think one word should be enough to describe the Phone is awesome.  you must not go with any other brand if you need A smartphone in 15000.  **The charging wire could be More long.     
Not a good product, ringer volume is so low you have to keep the phone literally in your hand or near your ears so that you can listen the incoming phone.    
looks very beautiful with golden body  looks very beautiful with golden body  looks very beautiful with golden body  looks very beautiful with golden body  looks very beautiful with golden body      
i used j7 and sell it on olx 1000 rs less as i find some issues.. 1. sound is very low you miss many imp calls 2. camera quality is not good 13mp. some 8mp are better that this .. 3. very few sensors.. 4. a technical issue i faced while watching online YouTube video some time it pauses and i have to manually press the play button to play it back. and also one more issue while watching YouTube video in 0 volume..some tyms volume increases automatically to 15 lever..wtf.. 5. no music player installed 6. no gorilla glass protection. even 5k phones having gorilla glass today.  2 things i appreciate for this phone that it has no heating issues and battery back up is very good.     
J7 is a good handset overall.but after using for 15 days ,the battery is not getting charged and a burning smell is felt from the usb tip,the usb tip and charging point is now in a burnt condition i have applied for a replacement . hoping to receive a good piece this time Cons 1 .no 2gb ram 2.only front light no flash 3 no full hd 4 cant hear the ringtones 5 got battery charging issues 6 no upmarket headset    
FlipKart Service Is Awsome But Im Not Happy With This Product, I Replaced The Mobile With New One But Again Same Problem Is Getting, Battery Draining Fast, And Heating Alot :(    
Price is good, Product is excellent, features is tallented all in all Samsung company amazing mobile..    
THE GOOD POINTS, 1) LOOKS AWSOME .. THATZ IT..  I HAD ORDERED THE PHONE 3 MONTHS STILL AFTER CLASHING WITH FLIP KART THEY HAD DELIVERD THE PHONE 15 DAYS BEFORE  IN 15 DAYS I FEEL THIS PHONE IS PATHETIC BECAUSE 1) NO GOOD SOUND QUALITY 2) LOOKS LIKE GRAND 3) NO RAM GIVES US BOOST TO DO MULTITASKING  4) AND YES PATHETIC RESOLUTION EXPEREINCE 5) BOTH THE CAMERAS ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH TO TAKE A SELFIE OR PIC SO GUYS DONT BUY ITZ MADE IN INDIA PRODUCT BUT I FEEL ASHAMED TO SAY THAT ITZ MADE IN INDIA BUT YOU GUYS SUCKS...    
This phone battery status not showing properly (at a time stand the battery charging status 80%, but not change after using the phone 2 or 3 hours) when the phone is switched off or restart then the charge power 2%    
not satisfied at all with camera  my moto G first version 8 mp camera resolution is better.  And sound too could have been a bit better.  Else phone performs good.    
samsung j7 strat speaker problem continues in ringing alert ,music,so i have switch off and switch on mobile so my problem temperary gone but few days its come again very low speaker volume that u cant hear     
worst phone ever,dint expected from Samsung... poor camera quality... rear camera not like 13mp its look like 5mp..front is also poor  disappointed From Samsung  overall good..    
I got this phone yesterday and I fond it is having only basic features nothing more that and camera is not good even not match with 8 mp cameras and front flash is not auto flash it will be on every time when you use flash. Both cameras not having good quality, its giving just a sharpened pictures to make us feeling like sharp finished pictures  Its not worthy for money    
Awesome device in this range camera clarity battery backup excellent only one short fall in this device ram giving 1.5 instead of 2 GB but nice phone    
Quality:- 1=&gt; 13 MP Camera Best Quality. 2=&gt; 5 MP Camera with Front Flash Best Quality. 3=&gt; 4G Faster Internet service. 4=&gt; No Hanging Problem. 5=&gt; Battery Backup Is Good You Expect From 3000maH Battery. 6=&gt; Awesome Display. 7=&gt; Smooth Touch.   Rejection:- 1=&gt; Loudspeaker Sound Is Not Loud. 2=&gt; Normal Type Headphone.    
Cameras quality is not too good according to other Samsung 13 MP camera. Front camera was like a VGA. After 15 days it's starting restarting while calling and while charge the battery. Phone heat upto 45C. While you use on 3G continues 1 hour.     
1st of all thanks to flipkart for fast delivering.thanks to samsung for greate facility in galaxy j7 smart phone,there are 5mp front flash and 13mp flash camera ,support 4g lte thats great feature One offer is ,i got activate airtel 4g sim also along with the smart phone,so thanks 2 flipkart again,over all good feature in this smart phone,so do not wait ; think about this smart phone...so go for it guys.....    
I having been using it now for about 3 weeks and am very pleased with the choice I made.  My usage is typically for email, twitter, reading the news, music etc and wanted a phablet and this phone suits me perfectly. The phone is fairly large but fits comfortably in my hand. The screen is very clear and makes for easy viewing.   As far as network usage is concerned, I use WiFi and Airtel 4G with have most apps syncing in the background. Typically I am on screen for 6-7 hours and have been able to get ~30+ hours on a single charge.  The camera is decent and takes good photographs in well lit outdoor settings.   Some things that can be better 1) 16 GB is perhaps fairly limiting as only ~11.5 GB is available for use so an SD card is needed. That said, there is not a lot of bloat loaded by default. 2) The speaker / ringer volume, as others have mentioned, is fairly low so you might not hear it if the phone is in another room. Listening to music with headphones or connected to the car stereo doesn't have any issues though.  All said, so far a great buy.    
SAMSUNG J7 phone is very good phone !!!  Flipkart delivery is as usual awesome!!  But the Seller has not packed the phone properly!!!  Be carefully with the seller whom you choose... rest all are upto the mark..    
What a piece made by samsung. good one i liked it just the sound of phone should increase but its beats are awesome. Good mobile for 14k and its very slim and too light. ATLAST i love it .  THANK Q SAMSUNG.    
it is the best fone in brands like samsung it has very fast processor and the best thing is the power efficiency of the fone it can easily last for 2 days.........camera quality is superb.and at last flipkart delivery awesome......    
i buy this phone is very luck in gold color mobile phone. its very smooth handling with lolipop android. nice to camera quality, flash, display is amazing. i like it.    
Samsung the name is itself the best.. This mobile under 15000 is the best camera is best both rear and front ,processor works fine no any minor heating also... Ram works fine no lag compared with moto x play.. screen is super amoled looks great iits better than any screen i think this is best mobile i have use , Ihave also used lg g3 but the samsung has done a nice job  Thankyou Samsung and Flipkart    
Every j7 heats, as it has an octa core processor, but check out for any software lags, if your piece has it then get it replaced.    
after using this phone I found  pros: Looks are good... :) Display is too good..:D Cons: Battery lyf can be much better, Ringer volume is too low..:( Camera in low lights giving blurry images..:'( I mainly bought the mobile for picz purpose, but it didnt satisfy me.:/ So i just returned it.. Thanks for flipkart for its excellent cooperation in terms of service.     
Nice product. Operating brilliantly. Must buy phone with such awesome features at this price. Good camera both front and back. Brillaint flash both side. Very much usable space. Ram is enough to operate any game. One word at end ....it is just an awesome phone.    
The best thing of this phone is its speed and performance ...slim design and disadvantage is little less ram of 1.5 GB and free available is 400 MB but this does not hamper its performance you think in this way.I am using this fone for 1 month having any hanging problem and heating problem.In my view brand and specification is packed here.     
Nice phone in all respect except the ringtone volume is very low. Camera quality, battery, processor, RAM, looks everything is good.    
Awesome Place to shop anything that u want no tension for price and product originality so i prefer everybody to shop anything from this site.     
I strongly recommended to BUY this Phone. I strongly recommended to BUY this Phone. I strongly recommended to BUY this Phone.    
I am fan of samsung phones  before this phone i used galaxy grand and this phone for 2 weeks ..... Pros :  best display.  good battary backup 1.5 day (with 6-7 hours WI FI uses).  good speed .   Cons:   Autofocus is fast but Camera is not upto the mark (specially for rear ).  Very low sound.  Rating 2 Stars ..because camera of samsung phones is nice but not in this phone ...     
Overall it is a good mobile but when coming to camera it doesn't work properly when we takes shots from this mobile it doesn't reached 13mp so I was disappointed. Otherwise it's a great mobile system UI is also great    
Ok so after reading all the good reviews i bought this product....within a week i start facing problem....all the apps start crashing ..i called samsung, google everything but nothing Then i got the exact problem apps in memory card were crashing only ..so i bought a new memory card but same .... So i called flipkart and they replaced the product that was awesome from flipkart side but same issue with this device also...just wanted to tell you this device is having some kind of hardware error in detecting memory card....it will keep on unmounting it then u have to open and reinsert memory card again....otherwise all ok  and yaa please see for ram you will get just 500mb of free ram...its better if u go fr different product in same price range    
super product from samsung..display,screen size,processor.camera.all features are outstanding in this price.only negetive side is speaker volumn...which can be slove by download app from playstore..and thanks flipkart for quick delivery

good mobile in tht price point, value for money. Otherwise it is a good one to go for...One suggestion.. if you are planning, Pls go for Gold colour as it looks awesome. All the best!!!    
This is awesome....I love its battery backup and picture quality. J7 full fill all the needs which any user wants in a Cell Phone. Thanks to Samsung for this awesome cell phone. A special thanks to Flipkart to delivered my phone within 4 days.  Thank You Very Much To Both.....Thanks, Thanks, Thanks..... :-)    
the phone is very good with no hanging problem its gold colour looks very stylish and premium but 1 thing i noticed in 20 days is its camera is not good we do not get clear image...so...before purchasing think about camera.....................    
I loved the phone ... i bought j7 gold and its gorgeous ... people are complaining about Ram but for me 1.5 is fair nough .. camera is too good ya volume is bit low but not an issue for me .. the back is bit delicate but thts fine ... rest is awesome ... thanks flipkart ur service is awesome as always .. guys go for this phone!    
When bought NEW and load all the apps..its nice for 10 days only. After few days it shows its actual performance. 1) Phone always hangs if you receive multiple calls or if call waiting is enabled 2) Phone hangs when you have so many contacts and while you search for contacts during a call. 3) Sudden reboot.  Worst experience...I was using HTC before (desire 816). I have never seen 816 hanging though the specs are lower than Samsung J7..    
This is an ideal android phone from Samsung at reasonable price. Android Lollipop feature is good, and twin side camera enables people to take selfie as well. Battery life is excellent, and once charged, you dont need to recharge for 2-3 days.  This review is given now, and would be reviewing the same after six months.    
Excellent phone surely 5 star rating Gaming experience is awesome, very good graphics better than samsung S4. Camera also excellent. Overall best phone. worth buying.    
Great sub 15k Phone. Positive: 1) Good display 2) Nice build quality for sub 15k phone. 3) Good battery backup 4) Smooth UI and improved touchwiz looks good. 5) Good camera and good shutter speed. Negatives: 1) Very small charging cable. 2) Earphone accessory with phone is not that great    
it was good to handle looks handsome, display was superb but front camera is not that much good, not getting a good selfies, camera options are not good over all the price is very high comparing with the quality    
I got the phone a week ago.Everything is good but phone lags a lot and suddenly during calls and running apps it restart.. Not Satisfied:(    
One more awesome project from samsung...No mobile can beat J7 at the cost of 15k..It would be better if the RAM is 2 GB...Any way excellent product from samsung...    
his phone is looks and performance is too good i sugest to user if you think below 15000 phone this is great phone to purchase... once again thank samsung and flipkart    
I bought Samsung j7 gold on 28th sep and was delivered by 1st oct. Device was in great condition , good battery backup and faster charging 40-99 % in 30 min. great browsing speed than on other phones. Better choice than phones in 20k range. Thanks to front flash for great selfies ;) . SUPERB GAMING. No noticeable heating after hours of watching movies on youtube or ISL on hotstar continuously. s AMOLED display id great.. good viewing angles... grat colors.. I was confused with asus zenfone2 ze551ml 2gb but my choice left me no regrets..    
Best deal in all Indian site,s for flipkart.com  best deal, original products ; all India delivery.    
Extraordinari mobile Under 15000 I buy 2 weeks ago Battery awesome 3000mah 2 days come Fully games playing 1 day come No hanging No struck No heat (some times big games playing heating is there)

I have been using this phone for the past 3 weeks now and I'm very happy with my purchase. Flipkart service was great and I got the mobile on time and in good condition.  Pros: Great Screen Great primary camera  Smooth and fast interface Excellent battery life  Cons: Speaker is soft Sometimes the motion sensor doesn't work well Front camera is below average  Overall good phone. As of now I'm happy with it.    
I got this a week back.. touch is nice.. i installed a EA sports game and it worked fine.. I will update my review once i use it more.. ! so far all good.. nice display and touch..    
i had to return this phone as the ringer volume is abnormally too low.. i was never ever able to pick any call as it was never audible.. even if the phone is lying next to me ..it was never audible enough.. which is the worst thing about a phone as the basic need of a phone is to pick calls and read msgs on time but was never able to do that with this phone.. rest all is good

This review I am writing after 25 days of my usage of the Samsung Galaxy J7 smartphone. The phone I found is typically Samsung design phone and looks with specifications are quite similar to other Samsung phones. Still the J series phone of the Samsung, it has tried to launch budget phones for public at large. The packaging of the phone is not up to the mark I would say as it is having a very thin cardboard box with single side open and not a full two cup box. All these are the measures of cost cutting. The specifications of the phone are very good with a long 5.5” display screen and I purchased a gold colour. The looks and feel of the devise is very premium with touch wiz user interface of the Samsung.  The followings are pros of the phone: 1. Build quality of the phone is very good. Overall feel is plastic but the material is up to the mark. The phone is very attractive and gives a premium feel while usage. 2. Android version is 5.1 Lollipop with Samsung touch wiz. 3. Ample RAM i.e. 2 GB does not lag in the general performance and gaming performance of the phone. 4. Large 5.5” screen with reasonable screen to body ratio looks a small device in hand. 5. The colour display quality of the phone is good but I feel that the colours are more fluorescent then the original. 6. No lag and heating issue noticed. The phone fully charged within 2.5 hours. 7. With moderate usage, the 3000 mAh battery last for almost more than 20 hrs. 8. Main Camera is 13 MP rear and 5 MP front gives good quality pictures. Both the camera picture quality is more than satisfactory and the phone is having front flash too along with the rear flash. However, the front flash is like a LED light which lights up continuously if flash is kept to on mode. 9. Sound quality of the phone is very good 10. Touch is very smooth and super AMOLED display gives a very good quality experience. 11. Dual SIM support, primary SIM is 4G enables and the secondary SIM is 3G. 12. SD Card support and claimed up to 128 GB. 13. Performance packed Octa Core 1.5 GHz Samsung Exynos processor The followings are cons of the phone: 1. The bazels of the phone is made of plastic 2. The phone is heavy in weight. 3. Much of bloatware preinstalled in the phone which are not uninstallable. 4. No gorilla glass protection to the device but may be saved by installing a tempered glass. 5. The network connectivity is always an issue with Samsung devices. At a location of very weak signals, it gives a message that your device is not registered on the network. I have either to reboot the device or go to Airplane mode and come back to normal mode for getting reception. Other colours available are Black and White however, my personal choice was gold hence went for the same. It uses micro SIM on both the sim slots. Still, with the above experience, I would certainly recommend the phone for big screen lovers with mid-range priced phone.    
VERY NICE PHONE. NO heeting no hangig problam so slim ; good 15 k. camra so so good not avery good outdoor photos indoor is not good!!! over all very nice ; thaks FILIPCART. may phone delevr date 5 oct 2015 but only 2 day delevr to filipcart thaks all sport tem.

amazing phone .. but im not able to get s view flip cover with sensor anywhere . despite this phone has hall sensor which supports s view flip cover. kindly someone suggest where can i purchase original s view flip cover     
Thanks to the flipkart for timely and fast delivery of the product. Received the phone in a brand new condition ; with proper packaging ; protection. Golden look is quite fantacy. Everyone is admiring its look whoever is seeing. Everything as described on the flipkart is found genuine. Loved this phone ; Flipkart also. :)    
I am really surprising to see the review of this product especially excellent camera.  I lost my 15000 rupees.For me not a single pros for this product... Camera is just ordinary.. My YU Yuphoria has better picture clarity Display resolution : the worst.. when you zoom any image taken it shows grains Sound: Keep an additional speaker to hear the sound.. always keep it in pocket with vibration else you will get always miss calls. I never suggest any even it drops the price below 10,000. Go only if you are a avid fan of Samsung and you think 15000 is nothing for a mobile...    
Display- 10/10 (Super AMOLED HD )  Camera- 8/10   Sound - 8/10  Sound air/headphone - 10/10  Battery - 9/10  RAM - 8/10  Over All ur choice...............................................................................................................................    
have ordered the phone on 23rd sept ; got on 25th so hats off to flipkart delivery  about phone, its gud,  Pros. 1. Nice display 2.fast charging 3.expandable memory upto 128 GB 4.battery backup is ok, can't say it superb as used sony T2 ultra prior ; same battery was there but T2 backup was superb 5.removable battery 6. both sim activated along with memory card if compared to E7. 7. Its best in this price range @ 15k  Cons. 1. Battery drains fast 2. when disconnecting call its got hang for 4-5 seconds 3.RAM management is poor only 250-300 mb free. 4. while you unlock the phone, other apps open automatically like camera, gallery etc. 5. its hang little bit while using heavy net surfing, if u are a heavy net user, sorry this phone is not for u guys. 6. No led notification which should be there at least as it is available in other phone starts @ 5-6 k  Over all gud product if you are average user.     
The phone is almost perfect at 15k. I will just share some of its cons.  1. No Backlit hard keys. 2. Just a bit less of RAM. 3. No Haptic Feedback found yet ! 4. A bit less of resolution for 5.5;. 5. Very Low Volume. 6. Battery not upto expectation.  But if used in general, its still a Beast Phone in its range with the tag of SAMSUNG. Kudos !    
All the features are good but the signal reception is very poor and also the volume is very low.........    
Pros 1. Awesome Display 2. Lags Free 3. 1.5 GB of RAM handles the phone well 4. The TouchWiz UI is good and have a lots of customization 5. Processor is also amazingly fast and runs games smoothly 6. App are movable to SD card 7. Sound quality from jack output is good 8. Design is a rich of a kinf 9. Supports OTG 10. Lollipop out of the box  Cons 1. Ram should be of 2GB 2. Ambient Light Sensor doesn't matter to me cuz I always set the brightns manually so it is not an issue for me but can be to some 3. Compass Sensor is missing 4. Speaker Sound quality is good but the volume is quite low.. If the J7 has the compass sensor, 2GB of Ram and Some more volume.. The It'll be the most amazing mid-range device ever produced by Samsung    
This Phone is Simply super.If you are looking to buy phone under 15k this is perfect phone. Review after 18 days of use.. 1) Display is pretty good with vibrant colors. 2) Touch is smooth and responsive. 3) Build quality is good and look of this phone in gold color is great. 4) Camera quality is simply Brilliant(Both front and rear) 5) Battery backup is goodas you expect from 3000maH battery. 6)No lag or hanging problem as of now and you shounld not expect hanging problem with 1.5GB of RAM and Octacore processor. 7)Slim and Light Weight. 8) Front Flash    
amazing phone .. but im not able to get s view flip cover with sensor anywhere . despite this phone has hall sensor which supports s view flip cover. kindly someone suggest where can i purchase original s view flip cover    
don't need to give a review. Just go for it with out any hesitation . And u will be just speechless after getting it in your hand.    
You Won't Find A Better Smartphone At This Price! Battery Is Unbelievably Good And The Camera Is Just Awesome Rear Camera Is 13 MP With LED Flash + Front 5 MP With LED Flash And Both Are Very Clear. Gaming.....Yeah This Phone Is Specially For Heavy Gamers, The New Exynos Processor Work's Flawless and you get Loads more feature that you wont find even in a 20 K Phone other than Samsung's.

Thanks Flipkart to bring my samsung J7 within 3 Days. Its a nice experience with Flipkart and product is Amazing.    
pros: super fast mobile camera quality is upto the mark battery backup is nice performance of the mobile is nice call quality is nice super fast delivery by flipkart in good condition. giving the review after using my mobile for half day i strongly recommend this mobile to everyone THIS IS AN GENUINE REVIEW FROM AN GENUINE BUYER hope this review is helpful for people thinking to buy this mobile ~thank you    
I agreed with Raj review on 12 sept 2015 with regard to the problem that this phone gives. The phone becomes non reachable to callers at times especially when set in LTE mode. The auto mode of connectivity is not functioning as automatic, it sets as LTE mode only, when kept in LTE/WCDMA/GSM and also stick to WCDMA mode only, when kept in WCDMA/GSM mode. I am sure that this connectivity issue is because of this technical flaw of non auto switching of connectivity modes as per the signals strength. This problem has made me to put the phone on GSM mode only while expecting calls. How can this problem be resolved?  Excluding THIS , All other features of the phone are SUPERB.    
order got delayed to delivery. FK team added a discount of 1k  Overall happy with the purchase and with flipkart    
lightning fast ,superb touch pannal, exillent camera good screen slim body overall it is a good phone    
Nice looks .. average performance... Some cons: 1.5 GB ram is very low... cant open more than 4 apps at once. Mind it some apps remain open always by default like truecaller, whsapp, messages No samsung music player. Low internal memory Very low on tech i.e not much upgrade on functionalities- old soul in a new body  Overall, you can buy if these things don't bother you much... rest seems fine.     
NO COMPARISON WITH OTHERS .. SUPER PERFORMANCE. AWSOME BATTERY BACKUP... ALL FETURES ARE GOOD. SOUND IS LITTLE LOW.    
I am writing this review after using more then 20 days,  i found this phone just a OK phone not great,  features of this phone are much less than my previous phone which was Samsung Grand,  many internal features like vibrate when call connect and many other are missing,  battery life is good,call quality is not great (comparing with Grand),  camera also i didn't found up to the mark definitely not looking like Samsung`s 13 megapixel and the single flash led is just ridiculous no combination of led with capturing,   picture clicked with flash just spark so bright which disturbs whole picture,  front camera is just ok too,  signal strength is also not good but not bad also,  display is good and super amoled makes it more beautiful and visible but a this price more better in terms of ppi would have been provided,  looks are good but chrome plastic borders are poor and definitely in long term use u will loss all polish better they have provided metal frame like A5 and A7 i don't think this would have cost so heavy to Samsung specially because this an exclusive product not available in channel so the amount of commission distribution is cutoff which should have been utilized to give to end customer,  secondary mic is definitely a miss too,  so short charging cable God knows by doing this how much corers dollars Samsung might have saved by shorting the length of wire,  charging is fast no complain about that,  Ram should have been definitely 2GB because at end use there is hardly any ram left which effects the speed,  i am not a gaming freak so didn't played the games on it,  ringer is slow not loud again same question how much corers dollars Samsung might have saved by placing a small n weal ringer,  poor quality earphones,  but the plus points in comparison to E5 E7 A5 is removable panel and battery which in future u will notice is an advantage and 2 sims and a memory card running at the same time,  i have purchased this product only on the brand name because its better to use a Samsung product rather than micromax gionee intex but i am not very happy with the product nor very disappointed just in between u can make ur choice.  cheers.....    
Samsung is looking best in hand as compared to its snap on flipkart. Very fast-no hanging,no apps crashing. I played asphalt 8 and leos fortune-without any problem. Display is very Good. Brand is always a Brand.Those looking for cheap phones like xiomi,Yureka,etc. My advise is to go for Samsung J7. Every friend of yours feel jealous. Camera Quality is very very stunning. You can use this phone as a beginner in Professional Photography. It also has acclerometer which is a good sensor for playing games.  The best super phone in 15000.    
Ok Camera not upto the mark. 1.5 GB is not sufficient. in same price or less please look for some better available options.    
Excellent ..Worth...Superb...OutStanding . simpy awesome good battery pickup ,stylish amazing cam especially front cam loved it ..    
i brought 4th sep Galaxy j7 gold edition,,, phone is suprb, camera is good ,good display, but head phones are very poor quality, and heat problem when mobile is charging    
superb mobile from samsung. plss go ahead and buy this.battery life is gud, no heating up issue, display, touch evrything is cool. 4.5/5 for this mobile. ring volume is bit low but its manageable.    
I ordered the product on 10 September but got it delivered on 21 only. Flipkart should seriously think about change their logistics partener if they want to retain their customers,Amazon can deliver in two days then why not Flipkart Anyways now coming to the phone.I must say a very good phone at this price range,below are the pres and cons Pros  1. Rich premium ,I had ordered the Gold one and trust me it really looks amazing and gives a rich premium look 2. Awsome dispay as they say super Amoled display which is quite evident as soon as you switch on the cell ,16 M colours give amazing display 3. Long Battery life,I had charged once when I received the set and it has been more than 14 hours still it shows 86%,so I hope it will really give long battery 4. Octa Core processeor, although I didn't use it much but for whatever purpose I used it the response was quick without any lag 5. Large internal storage ,Although the internal storage is 16 GB but only 11.6 GB is available to use which i think is still good enough  Cons 1. No Gorilla Glass, they should give Gorilla glass,if required can increase the price a lil bit but Gorilla Glass should be provided but that can be worked out with tempered glass 2. Low Ram ram should be at least 2-3 GB,although m not a much fan of gaming but for the people who love gaming lesser Ram might create an issue 3.Small Datacable,I don't understand what's wrong with Samsung ,why do they always give such small datacable/charger cables 4.Quality of headphones is not so great   Overall a really nice phone at this price range,Gold colour really looks awsom so go for it but please Flipkart try to change your Logistics partner or change the way they work so that we get the products delivered to us on time    
Best phone you can get for this price. There might be other phones with better features, but please note the SAR value of those phones. This phone is a decent phone if you are looking for a phone below 15k.    
Very nice product. Thanks flipkart for launching this wonderful product. M very happy about buying this and suggest to buy this with no fear    
Super awesome product by samsung. Very fast delivery given by flipkart.Looks awesome in gold color. Good display,fast speed(Octa core processor),good internel storage(16 GB).I am fully satisfied by this product. Thanks to flipkart.    
it is valuable things to our morden life. it very way of function to help our moveable life but regarding sound don,t mind are require more when play music after all it very very good mobile    
loved from top to bottom, font to back , Everything amazing. rear camera is great. battery life is good. No lagging problem during playing games. SAmoled glass makes touch better from other phones. 1.5 gb ram is good. better than moto g3 DISADVANTAGE Front flash is working like torch it's not blink during taking photo's.     
This phone works om indian sim only. Ring volume is bit slow. You can't hear it ringing in next room.    
Samsung handsets are well finished,it is a status symbol,I was with lenovo a 6000;s3 neo.Now i changed to j7.This is a well crafted machine .Pros;4g,admirable battery back up,removable also,super amoled 5.5 inch display,very good cameras with rear; front flashes,big but compact,No lag,no heat,native video calling facility.cons;low sound(ring tone is hardly audible),no ambient light sensor which is a must,no stereo speakers,low quality earphone,display is S amoled but trailing behind other samsung devices with S amoled display.    
No heat or hung up so far taken place as many people says about Samsung product. I'm using this mobile since 1st Sep 2015 (from flipkart) but little disappointed me of its camera department. above all, its a nice mobile, one can go for it...    
pros:-  1.battery life is superb easily last 2 days in med use and even more than a day on heavy usage 2.display is easily comparared by full hd display because super amoled is too crisp and sharp. 3.camera is awesome.(arre bhai mobile hai digital camera nii ki uski jaan hi le loge quality k naam pr) 4.processing is fast even better than all previous samsung devices.(exynos galxy s5 ka processor or wo v octa core) 5.slim one ; and gold looks great u can easy say your friends that you note 3...hahaha have done with my some of frnds. 6.good and cleal call quality.  cons:- 1.ordinary samsung earphone. 2.and speaker is little low  overall u cant get a branded cellfone with this much of features ans performance . value for money    
best display quality superb camera (front and back both). fastly charged  strong battrey backup compare to other samsung Handsets Gold colour handset is just great.. looks Royal very slim and fast  only one (-ve) point is 40% low sound compare to other Andriod mobiles ALL OVER ITS A GREAT COMEBACK BY SAMSUNG in this range      
I found this mobile best mobile ever in 15k. I like this very much from those mobile before i have. I don't find any drawback in it and the battery of this mobile is best.    
Must buy...waited and reviewed all other smartphones ...finally one should buy J7. Far more better than moto g3. At this price...it is really worthy..    
Hi,  I brought this mobile month a back since than not face any major issue with the mobile. I have obverse two issue in mobile first there is no inbuilt music player and second issue is there is slightly problem with camera.    
Mobile is really fast and good. Specially amoled display is awesome.mobile in golden colour making it very reach. But camera quality is not good in both of the camera. Front and rear. Picture are looking on darkest side every picture is captured with darkness. If they will be improve the camera qulity than its awesome    
I purchased samsung j7 gold. Waited for more than 32 days and worth to wait ..  I am using this phone since 21 days.  Best things 1. Awesome video quality 2. Perfect pictures even in dark light 3. Great feeling when you hold it in your hand 4. Fast processor not a single time it has hanged thanks to octacore  Buy something which has worth of it. Don't look at high configurations in 7k.  QUALITY is what samsung j7 says. Use it and then say about it    
After using this phone for more than 2 weeks, I'm satisfied by performance. The parameters are:-  a. Good battery back (with wifi, 3G On for 16 hr a day) b. Does not heats up c. Good processor speed. (I do not use games) d RAM usage 75-80% of 1.5 GB with Whatsapp, FB, truecaller, moneycontrol etc  2GB RAM could have been much better with Rs 1-2 K extra.    
Camera 7/10 ( front/ back) Screen is good but no gorilla glass  Battery is awesome ( i used for it for 2 days after playing also Sound low but decent Lollipop is also good and its user-friendly phone by Samsung and it doesn't lag anywhere    
1.Off Golg slim, looks pretty and gives a pinch of luxury...  2.Battery depletion is nicely managed with different power saving modes.(3000 mAh) 3.Both the Cameras are Good.... (But, Dual Led could be litter better for low light distance snaps) 4.Super Amoled display makes playing of HD Video/Pics/Games Simply Amazing. 5.Games run smoothly. 6.No such heating issue till... 7.net browsing is good with 5.5 inch screen. 8.OTG support is helpful 9.RAM(1.5 GB- its ok… (Expand)    
I was not expecting from samsung a poor quality of head phone.very basic which comes with basic phones.Overall phone is OK.    
Awesome phone below 15k...I made this purchase after long comparisons and reviews ...now i can say that my choice is just superb... I am so happy to make this purchase...no issues till now....Thanks Flipkrt for faster delevery..    
I bought Samsung J7 Gold few weeks back.. If you are looking for a phone under 15k then this is it...  PROS- 1. Super AMOLED Display is Awesome..  2. Good for Multitasking.. never felt laggy till now! 3. Slim and Light weight. 4. Rear Camera quality is pretty good.. autofocus is fast and accurate. Also works fine in low light conditions. 5. Front camera also works fine.. Flash is cool but not very powerful.. Sill usable for Vlog videos. (Note: I'm not a 'Selfie' geek :D ) 6. Games like Fifa 15, Nova, Modern Combat, Dead Trigger2 etc runs quite well.  7. Supports OTG. 8. Battery backup is Amazing. lasts more than 24hrs with Moderate use..(with Gps, Mobile data turned on).  Cons: 1.Speaker Sound is very low. 2.Does have little bit of heating issue while charging. 3.No Ambient Light Sensor and Gyroscope(I knw I'm expecting too much :p)  Overall this product is totally WORTH IT!!    
I bought this mobile after using note for 2 years.  Pros: Excellent display Fast focus/decent camera (Front and back) No Lags while working on multiple apps Gold color gives a premium look Slim and light weight phone Feels good hand with respect to Size.  Cons: Back panel is too thin. camera is not producing photos of 13MP types  Overall, a decent phone in this price range. Need to look at the performance in the long run    
Display and features are good.  But mobile sometimes restarts continuously by just clicking on the app icon.  It is weird but true .not sure if the problem is due to hardware or android.      
Thanks for flipkart for the quick delivery. I ordered this phone on 11.09.2015 and I received this product on 13.09.2015.   Samsung J7 is awesome phone under 15 thousand. the battery back up is awesome and front camera is very good for selfie lovers. its nice and very slim look specially gold color is awesome no hanging issue but sound is little bit low , over all I am very satisfied with this product. don't think and go for it.    
After using this phone I believe I can give a fair review. 1. Phone is GORGEOUS, It looks extremely classy. 2. FRONT CAMERA IS NOT VERY GOOD. For ex Grand prime camera is MUCH better. This front camera is a bit grainy, doesn't capture the colours too well. The colour looks dull. 3.Phone does NOT Lag.  4. Battery lasted from 8 am to 8 pm for me with VERY average use and LOW brightness. 5. Speaker is EXTREMELY low.  Final verdict : Not a good choice if you want a great selfie phone. Grand Prime/Max are far better. But it looks very elegant and is a good choice if you want good battery life    
I am happy with overall performance , rating 4.5/5 . I already had note 2 and i must say both can be compared on performance .Although they have different specs but still i find them next to each other .Anyways pls find details that i experienced after using j7 :-  Pros  1) Battery - Very good back up even after heavy use . 2) No lag 3) Display is very fluidic ; vivid  4) I am owning golden color and it looks decent .After all i am bored of using usual white ; black body colors  5) There is no ambient light sensor but still display is very clear ; crisp outdoors but then you need to adjust brightness indoors .But not problematic. 6) Camera quality is pretty good ; quality of image is very realistic .   Con 1) Volume is bit low . If i compare it with note 2 then note 2 volume loudness on 8 was similar to j7 volume loudness on 10 .But quality of sound is decent .   I am happy with my selection although i read some negative reviews about this product before buying it and was bit confused .May be some are expecting it to perform like flagship models costing 50 k + But now after using it i can say its decent on performance ; looks ; is a very good choice at 15000 bucks .    
Overall a decent device within 15k range. camera works very well. no shutter lags. ram should've been atleast 2gb. no overheating isues. excellent 3000mah battery. gives me a backup for 1.5 days.    
So....i am going to review this mobile phone.....in my opinion this mobile phone dont deserve 5 stars while...this phone deserve more than this...best phone... every thing is best in it..camera quality awesome..features awesome..looking slim and sturdy...gold version is best.....very stylish look..but little bit dissapointed in voice quality...but thats okk for me...flipkart deliver this phone very late but that was not flipkarts fault...they gave me 1000 rs.discount insted of this delay...so thats okkkk...ek galti maaf.....if u want to buy a mobile phone in range of 20,000 than this mobile phone is best...best...best...    
nice a recieve as i orderd. received before 5 days of delivery date. But Airtel SIM not working and Airtel support is not good no one want to communicate about activation the sim.    
VERY NICE PHONE IN IT'S BEST PRICE.. GO FOR THE PHONE.. U WILL NOT REGRET..  AS U ALL KNOW ABOUT THE BRIGHT SIDE OF THE PHONE, SO I M NOT TELLING U ABOUT THAT, BUT THE DARK SIDE I M FACING AFTER USING 3 WEEKS, ABOUT *THE BATTERY BACKUP AND THE SHIFTING CONNECTIVITY FROM 2G TO 3G OR VICE VERSA. **SOMETIMES SIMCARDS NOT DETECTED, AFTER RESTART IT DETECTS.  ***AS 3000mAH BATTERY THEY GAVE BUT NOT GIVING BACK UP LIKE THAT. SOMETIMES BATTERY PERCENTAGE IS GOING DOWN 3%-4% IN 2MINS IN NORMAL WEB BROWSING.THAT IS VERY SHOCKING.   I DIDN'T USE IT WITH 4G NETWORK.. SO TILL NOW I M IN DARK ABOUT THAT..  BUT REST OF ALL TIL NOW IT WORKS FINE..      
Value for the money mobile in 15k.Amazing gaming experience. No problem of hang. Good camera feature with front flashlight  Less ringtone sound.but quite enough vibration to obtain calls.     
&gt; No heating issue when we play high end games  &gt; Battery back is simply awesome... &gt; Most perfect mobile under 15K... &gt; It deserve to have this mobile under 20K..   Dear friends dont think second choice..Blindly go for it..it makes u worthy...    
I bought this phone on 23rd Aug, ordered on 22nd Aug by in a day service  Value for money in this price range.   No hanging problem  Look is also good  But all 4 offers given with this mobile are useless..   Overall phone is good.. i really like it..     
This phone is overall very nice.   Couple of issues noticed till now.  1. sound volume is very low  2. call drops or sometimes mute call (3 out of 10 times) could be due to Vodafone network but not sure about this. Planning to test it with Airtel network. Hope this is not a device issue.    
Thanks for flipkart for the neat delivery.  It took more than 24hrs for first charge to get 100% battery. Overall the phone is OK.  Eventhough it has 12 MP camera and 5 MP front, the photo quality is not upto mark.  Also it doesn't have Auto Brightness, so every time we have to adjust it according to the place.its a pain.    
the battery backup is very very good and very slim. overall is very good. we are happy to Samsung j7 and it is big screen and it is to weight.     
Received 40 days after pre ordering... (flip kart delivery not as expected) delivered my pre-order after starting open sales. writing this after 3 weeks of using this phone.  Remember this is a Mid segment model, don't expect premium experience. Still it delivers a lot..  Overall an excellent Mid segment Mobile From SAMSUNG for the first time.....  Pros:  &gt; surprised by slim and easy handling - exceeds expectation &gt; Marvellous and stunning display (to understand this play Mar jawan song from movie Fashion) - outstanding. &gt; silky smooth performance, First of its kind in Samsung brands Mid segment mobiles. Never hanged - Exceeds expectation &gt; Very few bloat ware - Good &gt; Outstanding battery, lasts averaging more than 1.5 days &gt; Good FRONT and REAR Camera &gt; Front LED &gt; excellent metallic finish body. really feels like metal &gt; Very less heating during surfing.  &gt; Didnt experiance Heating problem for 15-20 mins gaming.  cons &gt; Ringtone must be little more &gt; camera lowlight performance is ok, but not bad &gt; Missing gorilla glass &gt; very thin plastic back door, sometimes nervous to open &gt; have to download free bie games for the firsttime.     
On the very first day of launching Samsung J7 I ordered it for my younger brother. After seeing him using this awesome device I couldnt resist myself and ordered another one for me which I have received yesterday and trust me I am also one of the lucky dogs who could bang a Lenovo K3 note in its very first sale which is hardly 2 months back. But i was technically attracted rather seduced by the beauty and performance of samsung j7    
Good gadget at this price, great with 3000mah battery, 5v quik charger 13 mp auto focus rear cam and 5mp front cam with led flash    
Pros:  Looks majestic with 5.5 inch screen Battery backup is fine No heating issues  Cons:  No gorilla glass Cheap headsets Ringer volume is low Ram should be 2gb   Overall Its not worth investing 15k wen u have so many better mobiles available in the market.    
the phone's all feature are mindblowing,  but hte problem is with charger it's wire as short like it is a data cable and samsung giving a old model not improved earphone  if we take this problems as minor you can't take phone like this in cheep price like 15k    
First of all for delivery giving -5 Star to flipkart.  Now about the product after 3 days usage  Battery is very good last a day easily  Processor is good  Touch Is Awesome  No lagging Problem till now  The main issue is saw in this product is that it lacks sound overall good product satisfied with it...and flipkart need to review its delivery partners.     
I received this phone last week.  On the second day i faced first shock. At that night i saw my battery level is 64% before sleeping, Mobile data was off, Wifi was off. When i woke up, i saw my phone is dead. Put in charging and it shows 0% battery.  I still have no reason for this. Second shock i face when i was using camera from 4-5 min. My phone heats up. Third thing i am facing is When phone is in my pocket and it rings, It automatically cuts, because to cut any call only one tap is required but to pick up the call slide is required.  Overall phone is ok.    
Just awesome phone.  1. No Heating 2. Excellent Battery Life 3. Excellent Screen Display 4. No lagging/hanging 5. Excellent Camera    
pros-display- 9/10 2.processor-9/10 3.ram-9/10 4. camera-8/10  CoNs(not exactly) looks-6/10 batry backup-7/10     
Using this phone for around 20 days.   Pros:-  Stunning display Samo Led does its job, superior camera quality outdoor and indoor. Video recording s really good. Touch screen is very responsive. Good battery lasts for a whole day in heavy usage. In moderate usage it goes for 2 days in a single charge. Power saving modes are available but didn't get a chance to use. This phone is a performer in gaming no lags in asphalt 8 very smooth in gameplays all highend games work like a charm. GTA sanandreas gameplay was pretty good but some glitches although it's a very big game.  Cons:-  Really low sound. Can't hear the ringtone, you will miss all the calls unless u have enabled vibration while outdoors. 1.5 Gb Ram is not enough but smart manager tries to balance, but currently I have only 370 mb of ram available. Only watsapp and Facebook is running in background. If u try 'clean all' it frees up around 500 mb of ram but it will be flooded in few mins and feeling some minor glitches here and there in browser and facebook. Samsung must given atleast 2GBb of ram.   Other than this every thing works fine! Happy with samsung j7. Thanks for flipkarts fast delivery tooks more than 20 days since I prebooked, so I got a 1000Rs refund from the retailer happy for that!    
Without any doubt, it is one of the good looking phone(Gold Color) with stunning 5.5' AMOLED display.  It is light in weight and gives a good feel in hands.  Camera is also very good, with comparatively sharp pictures in low light.  Front flash is an good to have feature. Most games run smoothly. Battery backup seems to be fair(Have not tested under heavy usage).  No backlight on touch buttons, average hardware configuration and gorilla glass, which is a bit let down considering the 15K price tag.  So, if you do not want to experiment with the upcoming/new brands/mobiles, and want tried and tested product with great 5.5' display, look no further guys.     
Value for Money, Brilliant job by Samsung. Do improve in sound of the product as it sounds low. Excellent product for office users.    
BIG BATTERY  SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY NO HANG N LAG EXCELLENT CAMERA (FRONT N BACK) LIGHT WEIGHT  GOLD COLOR IS THE BEST SLIM    
Pros  1. Good looking phone  2. Battery performance is good 3. 1.5 gab ram seems compatible do multitasking without hanging   Cons  1. No notification light  2. Speakers are of so bad quality you even not hear when it's ringing  3. Camera quality is poor ...front flash is torch not flash    
Best mobile at this price point. Amazing touch screen looks great. Camera quality is top notch.Picture and videos have very high quality. Even after the video is compressed in whatsapp video quality is brilliant. Battery back up last for very long time.Quick charging. Totally impressed with the mobile. Best phone from samsung.    
I had purchased the samsung glaxy J7 one week ago .In the mobile phone the ringer volume is too low.    
I bought this Gold variant smart phone a week back so let me share my experience with this phone    pros:  -one of the best graphical phones for gamers with smooth graphics  -no issues with camera.front 5mp with flash and 13mp rear with best quality   -AMOLED display   -4G duos  -removable battery  -good battery backup  the battery fully charges within 1+1/2 hrs and lasts long till late night   -good performance. no issues with performance till now  -slim  -octa core  cons:  -1.5 gb RAM but good performance   -No back-lit.  -No Gorilla Glass.  -No flip cover and no otg cable is provided with in accessories   cons can be neglected at its price since its a brad samsung mobile  i recommend this buy     
Using J7 for last few days. This is one of the best phones you can get in the realm of the 15K. Honestly, the device is fast, handy and cool for the gamers. Battery life is great. But I am disappointed with the sound output and the speaker. My Samsung Tab 3 has much better sound quality and speaker power than this smartphone. The headphone offered along with the set is not of that great quality that you can expect from a brand like Samsung. Else, this is a great purchase! I liked it.    
After using for first day, this phone is really Awesome. I had perform AnTuTu benchmark test on this and the results very impressive. The Phone CPU is equal to Samsung Galaxy Note 4, at more than half the piece of Note 4, Good display. Great Price.     
love my new phone...amazing delivery by flipkart...got my phone one day from ordering For those who r confused between this n zenfone this beats zenfone for:- 1: NO CALL DROPS...just visit the zenfone website n see how many users have complained 2. SAMSUNG QUALITY N TRUST...service centre really cares fr u n is also spread all over india rather than asus ones..also asus service centers r more tending to repair laptops than phones..  well u may feel zenfone better in its features(even i was about to order it) but later i cancelled my order after seeing zenfone site....WHAT IS THE USE OF A PHONE THROUGH WHICH U CANT CALL HUH??....go for j7!!!    
Good Product From Samsung  Good Camera Also Clarity Low light,Smooth Display,Performance,Battery Thanks to Flipkart ; WS retailer Return Back 1000/-    
Awesome phone thank you Samsung and flip kart.For such a wonderful smartphone.  Great Performance. Long Lasting Battery. Awesome display quality. Fastest Processor. Great service by flip kart.  For service of flip kart 5/5.Flip kart karega apki har wish puri.....!!!    
Nice delivery timing and first value for money handset from samsung.lacks some sensors but still nice deal.    
i have purchased this product costing 15000, but the handsfreee which is provide to me is very cheaper quality and do not fix in ear easily. when a person is spending 15000, then co has to provide hifi handsfree. overall mobile is impressive.    
Really a very good product with nice camera clarity only negative about it is that it gets hang while using some apps.    
So Far No issues Like Hanging or lag  Front Cam is really Good nd primary one is not bad  Definitely i wud recommend to take this product It has got 38000+ in antutu bench mark which made me feel veryhappy  Only prob is It has No Gorilla but just go for it (display is awesome with amoled) and dont worry with Exynos or snapdragon The performance is gr8    
The Samsung Galaxy J7 with 5.5; big screen, front camera flash, Octa core processor, Makes this phone best ever Selfie and Gaming phone In it's price group. I personally recommend this phone over Moto-G3.    
An excellent product under 15k.. no issues with the performance battery is good and up to the mark front camera is awesome and rear camera is decent  gold color adds an premium look to the device  no hanging issues till 2weeks of usage  easy multi tasking   only thing missing is auto brightness    
Good Design Better camera Awesome Battery Life and most important Brand like samsung.. Don't think Before u buy just go for it.. No Lag Nothing, Ram is sufficient for Normal usage. at this price u cant expect more from samsung. GO FOR IT      
The phone is slim , no heating and easy to access . Excellent phone at excellent price from Samsung j7 The camera both front and rear and the camera apps are really good for quick photography.. Picture quality is excellent. Overall satisfied with the product..    
Good Product at reasonable price. Flipkart delivered the product very quickly less than 24 hours of booking. Nice work guys. Keep going!!!  Screen size is big as well as the battery power backup is good. Slim phone with neat design. Good RAM and Inbuilt Memory.     
I am not happy with UI of samsung J7. Battery back up is good. MI4, MI4i are better than samsung J7 in all aspects at equal price. Ergonomics needs to improve. No light sensor is the worst thing. Not up to the mark compared to price tag 14999 INR Go for Asus, MI, Lenovo for better quality and specification    
Some Pro's and cons: I have recieved this beast yesterday. Thanks to Flipkart for quick delivery. I got it within 3 days of my order. Some of the features that I would like to tell.  1. Sleek, Light and Trendy: 9/10 2. Superb Screen (AMOLED) display : 9/10 3. Octa Core Processor : All games are running smooth. 8/10 4. Flash and Camera: This is the new benchmark for camera. 13MP back camera which is just great. Added feature is the front flash. Front camera of 5MP. Selfie at a new height. Moreover, i found one unique feature. Wide Selfie. Try it out guys. 5. UI: It is great. With the latest Android version of Lollipop.  Cons:  1. No dedicated music player. 2. No LED notification.  Otherwise overall a 9 out 10. This is a must buy. Samsung after a long time wanted to get hold of mid range phones which they were outplayed by Moto and Lenovo.    
Samsung j7 best device but am facing an issue that every time my memory card automatically unmounted.......... daily and is there any method to solve this issue.  Thank You.    
Everything is good Except - Lower Sound quality ( External and In earphone as well) - Ram should have been 2GB  Display Quality , Design , Camera Quality are really Excellent

Falls short on the following features low volume Speakers low display resolution  Less Ram no backlit Single LED flash  For the same price Asus Xenfone Selfie comes with much better features.    
Only one word Phenomenal. I can't think of any other smart phone which had/has such an awesome battery life. Look wise very sleek and smart, Camera quality very good (both primary ; secondary). Display- I am just loving it. Sound clarity- Very nice. Overall it's a great experience as of now.    
i purchased Samsung Galaxy J7.. its really awesome... 1. Battery Backup too good 2. Camera quality better 3. no hanging problem... 4. samsung UI very very interesting UI...  but speaker sound not better ...    
Awsm phone in range 15k. Not hanging Isu nd camera is awsm. Sound is very low. Touch is very sensitive.. like butter. I love this phone.    
Ordered it on 25th July and received on 26th August.  Very good phone within 15k, Superb Battery backup ..... go for it !!!    
pros:1) Display is good 2) battery backup is good with 3G data on full day average gaming. I did not play havey game like NFS but candy crush saga ; soda which very sharp display game.  3) Look wise very nice feeling above 20K mobile. 4)   Cons:1) Ram should be 2GB 2) Speaker volume should be higher i have to assign vibration with ringtone to observe call at outdoor.  3) Heavy to carry with flipcover  4) No hardened glass is there for screen protraction.  5) Flash intensity is low compare to other samsung mobile like S3 Neo (i am using S3 neo already) 5) Camera is not up to expectation mark (it is average mark)  6) Only three sensor is there ,NO Compass/ Magnetometer,NO Ambient light sensor,NO Gyroscope ,they should be in this mobile. 7) No option key is there in front bottom only Home key,return key ; all application close key is there. how to type some input in some app like mobile banking app after login page.(state bank freedom app) 8)Speaker orientation should be at bottom. 9) NO adaptive brightness option. 10) Nowhere written Hardware is Exynose in the box as well as in the mobile, how to find that processor is exynose7580.    
Waiting for launching for boring, without any reasons for the delay. Very happy with the performance and speed.  Screen resolution and picture quality is excellent.  Best model in the market.  Kudos to Flipkart for marketing this product.      
best product from Samsung....though it could have better...  pros. 1)super amazing and optimized UI. 2)amazing camera both front and back...  i am disappointed that people are complaining about camera without checking settings  by default camera quality is set 8mp for back and 2 mp for rear.  3)super awesome display (very vivid and bright) 4)best processor in the range (its auntutu score was around 37k)  played mc5,asphalt 8 at max settings no lag. 5)no heating issues  6)1.5 gb ram well optimized(but it should have 2gb) 7)just amazing battery backup  cons 1)low volume as compared to other brands 2)short charging cable  overall considering price you should go for this....i was confused bw moto g3 and j7 but trust me j7 is worth the extra 2k.    
Great phone  Especially looks (gold ) excellent  Camera is excellent . Browsing is fast. Display is super. Sad not to have NFC.  Con : Not received any of the offers mentioned by Flipkart.    
Bot a J7 gold unit from Flipkart. As usual flipkart delivery was very good. Most of the good things are already highlighted, viz., 5.5 inch 720p display, 3000mah battery, octacore, super amoled. Coming to flaws: 1. Android buttons have no backlit, 2. No haptic feedback, 3. No notification led, 4. Phone appears like S6 in the images on flipkart, actual unit is far different. Cheaper gloss bezel. 5. Camera is avg. performer.    
Just go for it amazing display everything is awesome front flash is excellent ...  Battery back up awesome    
Believe in the brand. You will get full satisfaction along with with full specification.! Why J7? 1) Phone is slim and great in shape. 2) Camera quality is outstanding. Both front and back. Even in night you will be able to click outdoor selfie without any gains. 3) Phone display is awesome. If you want to revel the greatness of Super Amoled display, just go n buy and give a treat to your eye. 4) The golden colored set gives a elite look. 5) No heating issue and fast charging. 6) An absolute gaming console along with superb display without any lag. 7) Some have some issue on about the RAM of J7, nut trust me, RAM of 1.5 GB is absolutely optimized with OCTA CORE processor.    
Pros. 1. Phone display is awesome as mention Super AMOLED screen. 2. Operate very fast. Do multitasking smoothly. 3. Till now no heating issue. 4. Yes, OTG support, I connect my OTG pen drive. Connect and wait for 3-4 sec it will auto display your data. 5. Out of 16 GB 11.5 GB available for user.  6. 470 to 550 MB ram available for Use. 7. Touch is smooth.  8. Headphone average  9. Slim and light weight. 10. Fit in your hand.      
ordered on 1 month ago... got it 1week back... Really wrost delay delivery by flipkart am so dissopoinnted...  but Samsung J7 will satisfied me a great look:-) i like it... but oly cons is volume is bit low... best in 15k phone... everyone like its look.... thank u samsung:-)    
front camera was not good......and other features are good but charger cable is very short....and orginal samsung music player is not there......    
probably the best phone samsung has launched for 15k truly its a value for your money display is super awesome + the looks !! battery backup is just perfect and the phone looks so stylish and sleek the gold color is truly amazing :D GO FOR IT !!!!    
It's good to be purchased from flippant......better experience to buy this product galaxy j7 Rich looks,better performance and got in budget....    
After using this for 5 days i found certain observation. Looking at the specifications, the Galaxy J handsets seem to have raised the bar. Pro: Good Build quality Amazing Display NO Hangs Multitask well Camera quality is good in daylight In terms of battery capacity, which is the best indicator of overall battery life, it holds 3,000 mAh, a massive battery capacity for a phone. Given the basic feature which is required in the phone, no backlit display, omitted few censor like magnetic ....n others but that is fine  Cons: heavy phone(same feeling of Old Grand) No gorilla glass No compass Selfie camera and back camera is avg Only the Continuous Mode and Pro mode seemed to perform poorly. Continuous mode didn't actually capture images as fast as expected, and the Pro mode (manual mode) had fewer options than some other phones in this price range commonly offer. Nonetheless, the cameras overall seemed to be one of the new Galaxy J devices' best features.  in terms of appearances,the phone look more or less like every other Galaxy smartphone in the market. the phone sport anodised bodies, shiny cheap-looking faux-metal side bezels, and the same monotonous overall design profile. Overall good Phone, those who want the awesome display, bigger screen, battery life, good design can go for this phone.     
I ordered this phone yesterday and today its in my hand. This Gold version is awesome in looks.  Why you should buy this phone?  1:- For best camera and looks 2:- unbeatable gaming experience. 3:- Screen display is amazingly awesome.  4:- 1.5 GB of RAM makes it more faster than others (I have used Asus 2 GB but J7 is far better than that). 5:- OTG support. 6:- Front cam with flash. 7:- Very good battery backup.  Why you should not buy?  1:- Sound is little low. I will give 7/10 2:- No back-lit. 3:- No Gorilla Glass. 4:- NO LED notification 5:- Short Charger Cable  Overall I Happy With This Product Thanks Flipkart    
Ordered Phone on 26th July and received it on 25th August.. There was a delay in delivery though.. Never mind it..  Features are excellent given the price range of Rs 15000/- Userinterface, Camera, Looks, Audio and Video system.  Cons Headphone is not up to the mark Did not get benifts of Double data transfer as few of them have it.    
nice mobile from samsung.display quality is nice..best mobile for 15k...blindly go for this battery-10/10 back camera-10/10 front camera-6/10 display-10/10 sound-6/10  thanks flipkart  no issue    
Guyz i wana know what is battery charging time and battery backup time.. Amount of ram freee available for multitasking.. Please guyyzz tell meh abt dis above querries.. Thanks..     
woow.... amazing phone i hv seen ever.... camera quality is awesome such as DSLR.... awesome phone.... loved it....    
Only con of this phone according to me is 1.5 GB Ram. 2 GB would have made it perfect. The golden colored set gives a premium look. The display, camera quality, battery back up is just awesome. I was highly confused between moto G3 and J7, but camera quality was a major factor for me so I went for this. And i think I have made a good decision. Much satisfied. And yes, the phone was delivered to me in 1.5 days. Thank you flipkart.    
Phone is good as described in all the review, I only like to highlight some points: + Both the SIM slot can work as 4G. - Ringer Volume is very low, require (software) upgrade. + Photo is decent.  - Softwares not upto date, require immediate update. - Flipkart not included the 4G Airtel Sim as well as three other offers. + Delivery was very fast though the delayed product availability. - No accessories are deliverable by flipkart as well as available in shops in my city .    
The sound of this phone is very low, a small speaker fitted in back side which is not hear able when it placed on any soft surface even on full volume.    
late delivery by flipkart but phone is good  nice camera with decent battery backup , need 2 gb ram for better performance    
First impression - Awesome! Samsung has packed the same software that has been used in the Galaxy S6 and it is super zippy! Touchwiz has been toned down considerably. There is very less or no bloatware in this phone. Samsung has even removed a lot of widgets like its own music widget and app also. The battery life and camera is brilliant.  Here are some pros and cons -   Pros: Beautiful camera, Great display, smooth performance, Theme store, Camera quick launch, front flash, Excellent battery life.   Cons: No auto brightness sensor(it has outdoor mode though), Rear speaker but is fairly loud, no haptic feedback, No backlight capacitive keys.    
Here comes with my review for galaxy J7 Gold Variant. I pre order this mobile on 17th July but unexpectedly my order got delayed and I received on 25th August . first of all I am not at all satisfied with the kind of service by Flipkart for the first time for delaying my order when it was available .  Quite satisfied with J7 indeed .. Thanks to Samsung for making this mobile under 15k with rich features.  Pros:  1. The SAMOLED 5.5; is really amazed .Vivid and punchy color. 2. Looks wise its slim ; light weight and performance wise its awesome. 3. 3000 MAH battery life is good ..lasting for more then a day. 4. Camera is good both front ; back. 5. Fast charging. Take only 1hr 20 mins to 100% 6. Touch responsive is really awesome  7. Latest Android 5.1.1 8. Loaded with 4 Major games and works smooth  Cons: 1. Short charging cable 2. Volume output is low compared to any other 3. No Gorilla Glass (These cons are manageable )  This looks like you are using a premium handset. Happy Buying . Kudos to Samsung.    
One of the finest phone at this range. I like it. If u r searching for gaming phone at low price, then this is it. Phone is working extremely smooth, no hanging problem, ; camera shutter speed is really speedy. Also U will get 100gb one drive storage for 2 years ; 3200 Rs. gameloft credit for 6 months. I love it. Thanx to samsung ; flipkart too.    
Best phone by Samsung for the 15K with 4G ; 16 GB storage 1. Phone is slim and light weight 2. Display is fine. No hanging problems. 3. Camera quality is superb. 4. Battery backup is also good. 5. Awesome performance 6. Charging is too fast 7. Front flash 8. Wonderful Headphones     
Great phone. Awesome camera. Similar features like Note 2 except the S Pen and RAM  Major Cons : Samsung Account and Dropbox Account - Sync Disabled  Lost all my contacts since there is a bug in J7 that restricts from syncing Samsung Account and Dropbox Account  Sound of phone - 5 / 10  Informed Samsung about the same (Sync disabled)  Rest all is great. Its truly a phablet.      
DEAR FRIENDS  WRITING THIS REVIEW AFTER 4 DAYS USE  I HAD ALREADY USED MOTO G 3, LENOVA KILLER NOTE 3, BUT BUT BUT, SORRY THEY ARE NOW OUTDATED BY THIS FLAGSHIP FROM SAMSUNG  IT NEVER HEAT, FAST CHARGING, SMOOTH INTERFACE  I AM A GOVT EMP (RAILWAY RUNNING STAFF), NEED EASY INTERFACE, GOOD BATTERY LIFE, SUPERB SOFTWARE SUPPORT  PRESENTLY I HAD DOWNLOADED 78 APPS INCLUDING 7 HDD GAMES AND VARIOUS CONVERTERS, BUT THERE IS NO LAG AT ALL,   GREAT PHONE IN SLIGHTLY HIGH PRICE  ALL RAILWAY MEN, JUST GO FOR IT  IT NEVER HEAT, FAST CHARGING, SMOOTH INTERFACE    
only one word   THIS IS ITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT  all things are great except two things  1. output speaker is average volume not loud [ but its not a big issue ] 2. there is no auto brightness [ this is good bcoz there is no auto brightness sensor so battery life will increase ]   phone performance, camera quality [BEST] , looking [specially gold color] , display [ cummeswary] [ GREAT SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY ] ,battery are   SUPPER SE BHI UPPAR WAALE QUALITY    
Nice phone.. superb camera.. But sound quality and network connectivity is poor.. But still you can't expect everything at this price.. GO FOR IT    
For Flipkart: You guys are really fast. It's like you were just waiting outside my doors for me to order ;)  First is color: Nothing beats gold. I have gifted this phone to my fiance and she liked so much.   Look wise 4/5 : Old Samsung look Camera is best, front flash is big advantage. Battery is excellent.  I will update my review one i get the reviews.  I suggest for users with budget of 15K. You won't find better options.     
This is the Very good phone with nice slim look.  Special features:-  1) Good Camera quality and Slim looks. 2) Screen display and touch screen is very good. 3) 1.5 GB of RAM makes it more faster than others. 4) OTG support. 5) Front cam with flash. 6) Very good battery backup of 3000 mAH.     
Good phone released by Samsung. Overall response is good. But lack in Camera and back cover (Very thin). I experiencing the wifi connectivity issue. Its constantly dropping wifi connection in 30 second of time.  Does anyone facing this problem.    
For the first time in my life i bought Samsung phone as i always used Sony and the last phone i bought was Sony Xperia Z2. Unfortunately that phone was broken and bought Samsung J7 due to less budget.   Ordered this phone on 24th Aug and thanks to Flipkart, they delivered it on 25th Aug.  Golden color is the best color as it looks expensive.  The performance of the phone is good and no lag. Tried using 4G Services on the sim provided with the phone and happy with the speed.  Display is amazing better than T2 Ultra which i used before using Z2. Sound Quality is also good in earphones. What else do you need in 15k.  Totally satisfied with the phone and the performance.  The cons of the phone are- no light sensor which i never used in my previous phones. Light sensor can be ignored as the phones comes with the 3000maH Battery.  As water is the biggest enemy of mobile phones, the only con i found in it is that the phone is not dust and waterproof.  I was confused between Moto g3 and J7 but made my mind and bought this one due to octacore processor, expandable memory upto 128gb,front camera with flash for low light selfies, 5.5 inch super AMOLED Display, which is seriously very bright and vivid. The battery backup is also better than Moto G3 and of course looks, it looks sexy, more sexy and expensive than Moto.    
look : classy sexy slim camera : samsung quality maintained..front flash superb battery : 3000mah.. screen display : HD quality     
I had reviewed this product n then ordered but just i am facing 1 issue that is no default music player , i thnk that samsung will release a music player at next update :(    
this phone is the true value of money....looks like a very expensive phone  PROS: 1) Its look....awesome slim stylish look....seems like a very expensive one. 2) Its camera quality,no need to buy any digital camera 3)super amoled HD screen......make it special 4)no hanging problems 5)smooth touch response  CONS: 1) Small charging cable no more cons according to me........after all its a awesome phone in this range from brand like samsung :) a must buy for people whose budgets are around 15k.    
I am writing thi review after using one day..... Performance and Battery Backup so good Backup and Front Camera with LED flash superb   Ears phone not good,    
The lollipop interface with tuchwiz interface makes this phone truly awesome  The phone feels lite and since there is no gorilla glass i think samsung managed to give this out in cheaper price.  I have put a tempered glass screen guard as soon as received the phone.    
Got my phone finally after 2 months delay, but no complaint as flip kart gave me Rs 1000 discount...overall result of day one use   1) Downloading was fast,data transfer from my old phone to J 7 in 30 mins flat. 2) Charging was quiet fast... 3) Also downloaded from Wifi 20 software in flat 15 mins 4) Gold colour looks awsome 5) However ringtone volume is very less 6) Does not have auto light adjust 7) Bulkier then phones in this segment  But overall i would give it 4 out of 5    
First Impression after 7 days of use. 1.Looks 10/10 2.Colour(Gold) 10/10 3.Performence 10/10 4.Camera(rear) 8/10  (Front)7/10 5.Battery 10/10 6.Display 10/10 7.Loudspeaker 3/10 8.With Headphones 8/10 9.Touch 10/10 I surprise that with this kind of phone has no gorilla glass protection.But there is many product in the market like Tempered Glass Screen solve this issue.Last two days i use this phone rapidly and i would like to say its awesome!!!.After watching a movie for 1hr and 30min the battery goes down only 10%.Yet No lagging at all,super amoled display,great gaming experience.I think at 15k there is no any other product in the market like Galaxy j7.But the loudspeaker could have been better.    
Camera quality is superb  Touch and colours also nice Hang problem Sound is low but clear OTG support keyboard and mouse  Battery is so good I didn't get 4g airtel sim    
PROS 1. GREAT PERFORMANCE 2. DISPLAY ; TOUCH SENSITIVENESS WAS AWESOME 3. BOTH CAMERA WERE GREAT IN PRICE RANGE 4. NO LAGGING  5. GOLD COLOR WAS GOOD LOOKING 6. THOUGH WEIGHT MENTIONED AS ABOVE 170 GRM SEEMS TO BE HANDY AND SLIM CONS 1. LOUDSPEAKER SOUND WAS LITTLE LOW 2. ABSENCE OF BACK LED LIGHT FOR BOTH KEYS IS NOT AN ISSUE     
hi, i got a phone yesterday noon. all functionality is good except ear phone. ear phone to old technology. rest of good.  thank you flipkart.    
Pros-Good looks, smart finish, decent cams, responsive touch, Overall awesome phone for this range. Cons-No gorilla glass. So tempered glass is required for protection.  Have received the phone on 24-Aug. Delivery was delayed due to delay in production. But the wait was worth it....     
Worth spending 15K in a brand then going for some chinese phone in 10K.....Display is good...looks awesome..especially gold one...great performance    
First of all, excellent service by Flipkart got the phone within 16 hours of ordering.  All the features are excellent, especially battery backup is great    
The Samsung galaxy J7 is really an awesome phone within good budget. The design is slim,stylist and lightweight.The SAMOLED display has also good resolution specially when comes to hd movies and graphic games. And camera is also beautiful and a cherry on the top it has a Front flash also to get great picture in low light for selfie lovers. Samsung is doing great.    
J7 Awesome phone i have pre order this in the month july i got it camera clarity awesome battery back up is too good because 3000mh screen size is 5.5 looking good   but no memory card slot No gorilla glass     
its really superb and handy... color gold looks so beautiful. delivery from flipkart is really amazing fast delivery within 24 hours...nice to have the product    
pros 1) gold colour 2) display 3) multi tasking 4) Perfomance  cons 1) Sound very less  Best branded phone at best price   ws retail Quick delivery thanks    
I am considering one question before buy any smart phone, ;Do I really need to invest 30000 to 40000 for a smart phone; I mean I can put this money to my existing bike budget and can buy a latest Pulsar, FZ or Duke. That will give me more attention than a mobile phone. I can do lots of thing with this money then why a smart phone when I can buy a best mobile in cheap price. When I consider a phone I look after 4 things practically. 1. Screen (as if screen is not good you may regret every time you unlock your phone) 2. Performance (When you see your friend playing latest game you may regret) 3. Battery ( who likes to charge the phone couple of times daily, its irritating right?) 4. Look and Brand ( I assumed you need a phone which suite your personality)  Now coming to Galaxy J7.. its an awesome creation can give the latest SuperAMOLED screen which better than some FHD screen out there and consumes very less power. I can bet this J7 screen better than LG G4 screen. I have Nexus 5 and I have seen the difference. The 1.5 GHz Exynos 7580 Octa Core Processor is latest from Samsung and no heating at all like crap SnapDragon and no battery drain. This is my 1st device with Exynos and I am really happy after looking it performance and smart battery management. Now coming to battery its 3000Mah but trust me its the highest SOT time I have ever seen in a mobile phone. I get 10Hrs of Screen on time with playing games, web browsing and watching videos. That means a normal user need to charge the battery in every 48hrs or 2 days. Don't understand why some users written below that its getting one day backup. The highest battery life I have seen in any mobile phone that good. Now coming to Look, I know Samsung was poor in this but now Samu changed. The phone looks and feel really premium. The only downside you may think is 1.5GB of RAM but dont worry its a LPDDR3 RAM and more faster than so called 3GBs in market. For a mobile phone and gaming its more than enough and power saver as well. What is the cost difference in 1.5 GB and 2 GB LPDDR3 RAM? Might be no cost or 1 dollar maximum. Samsung made this difference only because of Medium segment marketing tricks as If this mobile given all the features then who will going to buy a premium phone like S6 or Note 5 which is big revenue generator for Samu. So do not think much and go for this blindly. You will happy for next 2 yrs. Do not go for Snapdragon devices as they are not battery friendly and heats a lot. Specially the resent 800 series. The latest 810 also a failure CPU. Be happy and choose wisely. Respect your hard earned money.  -Punyaslok Dash     
I received the phone yesterday at 1pm and today its 2pm when I am  posting this review after almost 24 hours…..i Pre-ordered it on 16th July 15 ..bit frustrating as its too late but flipkart gave 1000 discount as goodwill gesture so happy for that…thank you flipkart   Pros Build Quality is good..its light weight Camera is quite Clear 13mp does capture nice photo(can not compare with s4 camera) AMOLED is super clear to read and view image,videos Processor is really very fast,,,in just blink it install and uninstall any apps the inbuilt app called Smart manager is superb…it boost battery,Ram,Storage and Antivirus protection well the lock screen animation is amazing new in this model. Black color is awesome and side rings are also dark shaded front flasher is also good but while catching photo its continue on so it goes in eyes and give some irritation Today it charged from 20% to 100 in just 1.48 hours I means its amazing..it will full charge in 2.25 hours only you can use MMC and two sim separtly (in Sam-E7 Model u hv to use either mmc or sim in sim 2) Octacore does well….Samsung has over come its hanging issue  It has power saver as well as Ultra power saver mode…….very useful to use each drop of juice in your moby.. Fits in the pocket well..not like my prev. note 2 that was hard to fit as its screen body ratio was high…and heavy too.  Cons headset Provided with phone is regular one not in ear…Dispointing lacks feature of multi-view which is common in latest samsung mobiles… do not know why? Charging cable is short.Sound seems to be bit low. ringtones provided by company will be difficult to be heard if you are working in another room and phone is in another room.      
truly an awesome phone by Samsung after a long time nice performance without any lags  pros: battery backup  5.5 inch super amoled display  front camera is 5mp with flash  fast 13 mp rear camera  Neutral: ram is 1.5 gb while similar priced flagship are offering 2gb or more but there is not much difference  cons: the only bad side of the phone is the touchwiz ui by Samsung which is a ram hog but this can also be eliminated by installing launchers   overall performance of is between very good to extreme which can also be defined by the benchmark scores ill give this phone 4.5 stars out of 5 0 star for the delivery by flipkart I ordered the phone on 22nd July which they were saying will be delivered by 30th august. on 21 august i cancelled the preorder and place a new order for 1 day guarantee delivery.    
Hello Friends, I got this phone in 1.5 days after ordering it from flipkart and after using it for 24 hours what i found the worst part of this phone is Volume, either u can hear it on ringtones, notification and videos. It is really a disappointment after getting so many good features the phone volume is very poor. If i have to rate this then it would be 2/10 because i used grand and other Samsung phones but the quality of volume is very poor. If Samsung can please do something for Volume then it would be good. Please Samsung!!!!!!!!!    
Overall all feature is Mind blowing.  Pros:  It's support OTG. Camera clarity is awesome. Super Amoled display is also Excellent.  Cons:  Led notification light is missing. Loudspeaker sound is too Low but it's ok for me. Out of 16gb available memory for user is approx. 11.5gb.  While writing review I am not install any app apart from existing app.    
First of all thanks flipkart for delivery within 2.5 days of order,well packed in plastic bag then cardboard box then that popping bag then the orange Samsung box  WHY TO BUY  1.under 15k 2.super AMOLED HD display(my personal fav since s3),colour is vibrant an feels punchy (some may not like it and want full hd, but guys then the phones don’t perform well as a case with k3 note while playing intense games) 3.octa core 1.5 ghz exynos, which is custom made, wht is means is its made to satisfy the need of this phone specially  4.the RAM 1.5 gb may feel low as compared to phones like moto g3,asus zefone 2,k3 note,mi4 but the overall performance is far better than those.free ram I got after first boot is 500 mb. 5.OTG supported 6.internal storage 16 gb on board of which I got 11.8 gb free . 7.huge 5.5 display (black looks killer,deep black screen) 8.look premium and hawt. 9.16 mp primary camera, and 5 mp front with one of its kind flash. 10.ultra power saving mode can give you upto 5-6 days stand by time LITERALLY. 11.LOLLIPOP 5.1.1 out of box 12. 4g (unless you use it) 13.clean UI (not any funky kind off like those chinese rebranded) 14.low bloatware dis time. 15.slim 7.5 mm thick 16.ultimate for gaming 17.ultimately SAMSUNG  WHY NOT TO BUY AND FEW CONS 1.no notification LED 2. no backlit on keys 3.lacks few sensors (not to worry it won’t effect your gaming) 4.short USB cable 5.again those cheap headphones 6.no auto focus on 5 mp front camera 7.low light images may not be good 8.NO GORILLA glass (but there is something like glass ,additionally Samsung gives you a protective cover on top)  VERDICT -GO FOR IT     
Wow I have never came across such beautiful product of Samsung...Really awesome like camera quality, battery backup, picture quality amazing.    
the offers that comes along with the purchase of the phone are fake. After using 2 weeks , till date none of the offers were applied even after repeated calling to flipkart support .  also sometimes the phone restarts on its own .    
Pros 1. Super Amoled 5.5 Display screen : Don't be worried about the resolution or ppi, the Super Amoled will surely impress you 2. Processor : Exynos 7580 makes sure that no lags are there in the mobile 3. Look and Feel : Can match with note 4 or note 5, very slim. 4. Space : 16Gb with a additional 128 is a awesome storage feature 5. Ram : Could have been 2gb, but still ok. 6. Battery : 3000 mAH. 7. 4G  8. Lollipop 5.1.1  9. Camera : Really awesome. 10. OTG 11. Front Camera Flash  Cons 1. Speaker Volume : The worst part!  Remedy : I am using a downloaded classic bell ringtone. It boots the ringing volume a bit. 2. No Corning Gorilla Glass at 15k Remedy : Using a quality tempered glass. 3. Plastic Built : The back panel really looks very slim and fragile.  4. Missing back lights : 15k but still no back lights that's really bad Samsung. 5. Ram consumes almost 80% all the time. Only 250-300 MB is left free Remedy : Octacore will manage this issue. So far no hanging issues  Neutral  1. Battery : The backup is ok, not excellent or poor 2. Heating issue : I think the mobile handles the heating issue really well.      
AWESOME PH UNDER 15 K I GOT THIS PH ON 23RD AUG ; ALSO GOT 1000 DISCOUNTED. GOOD CAMERA QUALITY REAR ; FRONT SUPER AMOLED DISPLAY GOOD  VOLUME LITTLE LOW BUT IT CAN BE MANAGED 16 GB INBUILT MEMORY ENOUGH MEMORY TO USE WITHOUT SD CARD RAM LITTLE BIT LOW    
I was confused which phone to buy whether Mot G 3 Gen or Samsung J7 Well after going through the reviews I opted for J7. Best part is that this ph does not lag/ hang (which is major problem in Samsung phones) while playing games or does not heat as S5. front camera is good enough but the rear camera (as claimed 13 mp) clicks images same as 8 mp cameras. Color resolution is good But there are few things which the company needs to work upon: 1. Sound is too low (reviewers have given correct opinion on this) 2.Charging data cord is too short. 3. headset provided inside the box is not at all fancy or attractive. its the same old style 4. Company may kindly increase the RAM from 1.5 to 2 .. it will add feather to this product  overall a budget phone with good specifications.    
Hey All,  Samsung has really came out shown really what they are..  High end spec, Low cost.. Awesome Phone with low price,  Just Go for it. Reviewing after 2 days of usage.  Pros: 1. Design: Super Sleek 2. Display Super Ammo LED (Saves Battery and Gives Crisp Sharp Pic ; Video) 3. Battery. 3000mAh last a day long if you use 4G 4. RAM 1.5gb is enough because it has Exynos Processor which is very advanced in processing compared to other processors.  5. Graphic. Mali T720 MP2 which is 2nd gen advanced graphic. 6. Camera. 13MP Rear which is very clear Superb, and front 5MP with flash is also good for selfi fans.  Con. 1. No Sensor for Ambient Light.(Not make a much difference coz you can do it manually) 2. Head Phones are Bakwass 3. Sound(in built speaker) is too less. Should Keep Vibrating Always On else you will miss a call.  Over All this phone is awesome and big Punch for China Phones.  Go for It :)    
This phone is good one in this price range with limited uses however is not useful for high graphic gaming.    
Awesome phone!! delivered in 3 days running smooth. recommended to anyone who's looking for awesome phone under 15k    
I have used this phone for a fortnight now. It's simply brilliant for that price tag and is far far better than some of the recently launched (and more expensive) phones.  I was surprised by the superb software optimisation because despite less than 2gb RAM, there is no lag at all.  The best part of this phone is that I am not carrying my phone charger to the office :-) because it is giving me one full day of support. It charges quickly and there is no question of overheating. This is a certified gem.      
I waited almost a month for this phone, but it has let me down. I believe the real reason for the delay was due to some technical issue in the phone. I used it for almost 25 days and it didn't performed well. Restarted several times. Its a gaming phone but heavy games didn't responded well.  But I would say the customer support is amazing, who supported me well.     
Pros: 1. Design: Super Sleek 2. Display Super Ammo LED (Saves Battery and Gives Crisp Sharp Pic ; Video) 3. Battery. 3000mAh last a day long if you use 4G 4.

Battery is big problem..overall experience not good so far. Also didn't got any airtel data plan as committed by flipkart.    
I don't usually write much reviews but I will for this one since it's my new phone and all :p First of all Flipkart did a good job in delivering the product on time and well packed. I've been using this phone for almost 2 weeks now and I gotta say I'm really impressed by its performance. I didn't notice any hangs or lags while browsing, whatsapping, watching videos or gaming*. But the camera however isn't anything special as I didn't find the quality that amazing. It isn't exactly poor either but since it's a gaming phone, camera quality can be compromised. As for gaming I've played Asphalt 8 in high settings and there is a little bit of lag here and there but you won't be bothered by it so much. In medium settings the game runs smooth as butter. Also the loading time is fairly short so that's a plus as well. Then I played N.O.V.A 3, one of the most powerful and graphical first person shooter game and I gotta say the game ran really well without almost little to no lag. So gaming is perfect for this phone. One thing I want to point out is the issue I had when I charged this phone for the first time. Even after charging for like half an hour the battery percent only went up like 3-4 percent and 10 mins later I heard a 'tuk' sound when the phone charger literally got pulled backwards from the charging socket! After quickly turning it off, I removed the phone from the charger and charged it using another Microsoft charger I bought which is compatible for all phones. Guess what? The phone started to get charged by 3-4% in like 4 mins. So I'm really disappointed with Samsung for giving me a faulty charger. Anyway moving on the battery life is really great. Even after playing Asphalt 8 for more than 20 mins the battery only went down like 5%. And one more issue I faced was with wifi. It showed good signal strength but the connectivity was poor (whatsapp msgs took time to be delivered and incoming msgs were also delayed). After quite an amount of researching I got it fixed by a simple solution that is turning your WiFi power save mode off. Now to do that you have to dial *#001# and you'll automatically be taken to a screen. In the top right corner click on 'More' then select 'Wifi' and then turn Wifi power save mode 'off'. Reboot the phone and the issue is solved but I do think turning it off will drain the battery life a little faster than before. Finally the sound is really low for this phone. If you're travelling somewhere in a bus you won't hear incoming calls so you have to put the phone in vibration mode as it's the only solution (well either that or staring at the screen till you get off). While gaming or watching videos the sound is fairly decent although I wish it was slightly more louder. Anyway that's all I want to say about this phone. It's working great, no problems with any apps or softwares. If you like playing games on your smartphone and don't really care that much about high quality camera pictures, then J7 is your best bet. Rating it 4 stars :)    
Flipkart good service , Nice packaging  Phone battery good , Screen resolution good but suddenly after 5 - 10 days started giving ;NETWORK ISSUES; saying phone not registered on network.  Changed BSNL - AIRTEL - IDEA Sim but still giving me same issue .... I have reached Flipkart customer care for help and they gave me assurance that they will resolve this issue.   So fingers crossed.    
Committed and ordered bundled offer not given yet. While the same is so highlighted by the flipcart and delayed the delivery for phone also.    
I AM ALWAYS A SAMSUNG FAN, SO I HAVE ORDERED THIS HANDSET IN PREORDER STATE AND GET A DISCOUNT OF 1000 BY FLIPKART FOR DELAY.I WANNA SAY THAT HANDSET IS GREAT TO USE AND PROCESSOR IS SUPER FAST AN OCTA CORE FOR SURE BUT THE AMOUNT OF RAM GIVEN IS MARGINALLY LESS BUT DUE TO GOOD PROCESSOR MULTI TASKING IS RATHER EASY.ON AVERAGE RAM AVAILABLE IS 560-570 MB WHICH IS OK FOR THIS KIND OF DEVICE. 5.5 SUPER AMOLED CONSUME LESS POWER AND 3000 MAH BATTERY IS SUFFICIENT TO POWER UP THE DEVICE FOR ENTIRE DAY. BOTH THE CAMERAS ARE GOOD FOR THIS RANGE BUT NOTHING SPECTACULAR, F 1.9 APERTURE IS GOOD FOR FAST FOCUSING LED FLASH IS ESSENTIAL FOR LOW LIGHT IMAGING. DAY LIGHT PICS ARE BEST WITH HIGH AMOUNT OF DETAILING AND COLOR REPRODUCTION. CALL QUALITY IS EXCELLENT AND EAR PIECE IS HIGH ON VOLUME.  BACK COVER QUALITY IS ULTRA THIN, OLD SAMSUNG STYLE.  HOME AND BACK BUTTON IS NOT BACK LIGHTED SO TROUBLE IN WORKING AT NIGHT.  FRONT CAMERA FLASH IS VERY HELPFUL FOR TAKING SELFIES AT DARK.  LOUD SPEAKER IS NOT AT ALL LOUD THIS WILL CAUSE A LOT OF UNATTENDED CALLS.  MICRO SD CARD SLOT IS ABOVE THE FIRST SIM SLOT SO NO PROBLEM FOR   DUAL SIM OPERATION WITH MICRO SD CARD ON TOE. ONLY ONE SIM AT A TIME CAN USE 3G OR 4G. ANOTHER WILL BE GSM.  THIS IS A MADE IN INDIA PHONE SO CHEERS TO SAMSUNG.  LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST FLIPKART TEAM YOU ROCKS. HOPE YOU WILL FIND THIS REVIEW HELPFUL BEFORE ORDER.     
I am using this phone from a week now its just fantastic  Pros: 1) Great quality display its super amoled and you wont get it in any other brands in this price 2) camera quality is very very good, its using F1.9 aperture  3) OTG support 4) Premium look and Super slim  5) its supports all big games without lags 6) front cam having flash good for selfies 7) No heating issue like other chinese scraps 8) Fast charging  Cons: I haven't seen any con in this phone after all its samsung  Guys go for it you wont regret, its Totally value for money.     
Thanks to Flipkart. I received this mobile in one day.I think this is best phone in this specifications. I use moto g3 before this for 8 days ; give return to flipkart. Really good product  Pros 1.Display is Excellent 2. Super fast Octa core procecore Exynose 7580 3. Both camera is beautiful 4. Image quality ; viewing angle is Excellent 5. Slim ; light weight 6. Super clarity ; stylist 7. Outdore sensore is very good 8. No heating issue  Cons. 1. No Led light 2. Sound quality is low 3. Headphone is very bad 4. USB cable is very short  Overall,This mobile is very good, Excellent ; Amazing. Buy this phone....     
I have purchased J7 from flipkart ; I’m very happy with the phone, Thanks to flipkart for safe ; good product delivery. Compare with other phones, Samsung J7 is the best product launch with the low price... Please go for it….     
Ordered the black J7 and got it delivered within 2 days. Here's my review after using it for about a week.   &gt; The screen is superb (Super Amoled !!). 720p on a 5.5 seems perfect while viewing on this phone considering the price and screen type. Deep blacks and vibrant colors look just awesome on this big display. Absence of Gorrila glass is something to be careful about while playing around with this one. Yet, tempered glass might be a work around.  &gt; Camera (both rear ; front) are pretty good. The front cam performs exceptionally well in low lightning conditions even without the front flash. In normal daylight conditions, the picture quality is awesome from both the cams.  &gt; The speakers on this device are pretty low on output. But the sound quality from earphones is just enough to please any amateur audiophile. Just need to tune the equalizers and the Tube Amp.   &gt; The Touchwiz for lollipop has some smooth performances compared to earlier versions. We also have the new Theme Store which is another welcoming feature from Samsung. No more ugly boring interface!  &gt; This phone is a performance beast in this price range. No lags, smooth multi-tasking, faster cam access (double press the home button).  &gt; Battery backup is also appreciable. A normal full day usage still spares around 30%-40% battery. This device also charges a bit faster. Only thing is that the charging cable could have been much longer than the one provided.  &gt; The phone doesn't heat up at all. Even while intense gaming or heavy usage. Must go for this one!     
every thing works good. pros 1) camera both 2)battery 3)display  cons: only that it should have 2gb ram for this price,coz all other companies are providing 2gb ram. it works fine with 1.5gb ram.. but it could have been better if it had 2gb ram    
i ordered Samsung Galaxy J7 + flip cover ..they delivered the phone but not the phone cover.. they tried to attempt deliver at different state .so,.they cancel the products themselves, i made a call to customer care.. they requested apology and suggested me for a fresh order...totally Waste of our valuable time..    
I am writing it after 5 use. The new incorporated features are good and works faster. camera is awesome. But the company has left to continue the good features of previous edition like page buddy. I could not find the music player I am forced to use google player.  There seems to be a problem with 2nd sim slot. I have inserted a new Airtel Sim into the 2 sim slot and but same is hindering with my 1st sim's network. while keeping the 2nd sim inserted, if I switch on the mobile data for 1st sim, the network strength goes down. Thus either i can use the mobile data or i can make calls. I am uable to use both at same time. If I have to make calls I have to first switch off the mobile data and then wait till signal becomes strong.  The contacts can be set alphabetically either by first name or last name. The prefix has no value. For eg. if I save a contact with a name with Adv. Rohit Jain. Rohit being first name, the contact list will display it in head 'R' instead of 'A' So, nomatter what prefix you assign, the contacts will be arrayed as per alphabetic order of first name or last name only. which is annoying to me.   I am still exploring. It is disappointing me every day.      
cons 1. low speaker sound ...you are going to miss lots of calls..most important thing for a phone 2. Battery same old samsung battery problem.... 3. camera is worst....I hv a samsung galaxy s3(8 mp) its picture quality is better then J7 4. low in RAM.... 5. No gorilla glass    
Received this product about a week back.  All phones when new work flawlessly and run real smooth.The real test comes when you start installing some apps.  The ones I have installed are: 1. Whatsapp (resource hogger) 2. Good Software (office mails) another resource hogger. never works. 3. Gmail 4. Onenote (now disabled) 5. Others not of any significant mention. The moment I saw the specs on Flipkart, I thought, Octa-core should be one real good piece. One week later I realize that its actually a quad-core. 4 cores for damn samsung apps, while my apps get the other 4 cores (pun intended) Even before I installed these apps, I started seeing some lag in the phone. I guess its mostly damn WhatsApp causing it. Memory utilization is always around 80% which is a disappointment. I can always root my phone for a Cyanogenmod but Good software doesnt run on rooted devices. :( Basically this phone isnt good IMO. In one month its gona real suck.  I had a moto G 1st gen before this. That phone was faster and smoother than this for a long time. Later I rooted the device and installed a CyanogenMod 12.1 and it was even more faster.  I am really not impressed by this phone J7.  only positive is, it has a good battery life. Thats it!!    
An awesome phone by Samsung after a long time,nice performance without any lags. UI is good,fast,looks premium in 15K. Slim,light weight, and great value in low price,with all features of expensive ; higher smart phones.  Feels comfortable to use,without lags. Camera is superb,; very swift as compared to older Samsung phones ; easy to use.Picture quality is also great. CONS: 1) Bad Headphones, not at all comfortable to use.  2) Very short USB cable These costed Samsung the 5 star rating, My rating 4.5/5  . A good option for people looking for a smart ,trendy, faster smart phone in this budget. In short worth every penny, light n the pocket,HEAVY on functionality,performance ; style.  Really happy with SAMSUNG.  Flipkart as usual : Speedy delivery ; great service. Hi5 to Flipkart :)    
hi, i buy this phone today and i really happy because this phone is really awesome and its futures are also good ................    
1.it will shutdown automatically when u r in call.it will irritate me lot and i missed so many important calls . 2.if u install more than 7-8 apps it will stuck automatically  3. camera they given 13 mp but it in reality it will not give atleast 5mp quality also tooooo bad. 4.if u install more apps it will releases heat like any thing. 5.speakers will give very less sound . 6. battery will dry out fast. 7.call drop are more due to mobile not network.(they missed basic feature of mobile) 8.they given 16gb internal but if u used more than 4gb phone will hanged  worst phone which i seen in my life

Only because of WS Retail and eKart i prefer flipkart Earlier i ordered Canon 1200D through WS retail and it was a genuine product    
super phone camera super disply super performance good phone so simple flipkart very good thank you flipkart    
hanging issue  signal problem  touch is not working properly . sound system is very low ,we will miss the calls    
Very good and light weight. worth for money. latest android  phone works very smooth have not faced any issue till the date    
I have been using Samsung Galaxy S2 from past 3 years and 7 months and wanted a 4G phone with better price and as I need a phone which is as good as my S2! Well J7 is the best now in mid-range phones! Do watch 20 reasons why you should buy J7 and 6 reasons why not to buy J7 in YouTube! 6 reasons are fair and not major at this price when compared to any phones in the market and 20 positive things! Samsung is always the best and good they finally cut the price ! My S2 still works very well with no issues!    
i got 1 week before. Really super performance in speed specially 1.No hang during Games. 2.Good touch and good clarity of AM LED display. 3.Ringtone sound was much low to hear,so we need to add vibrate . 4.Battery was really good 1.5 days. 5.camera 13mp is ok only ..not excellent .. 6.No heat but playing games always give some heat. 7.worth for paying octal core processor. 8.Fast delivery by ws-retail within 4days.     
Recieved in 3 days Using it since a week.  so far its good.  Disappointed with speaker volume its very low. u may miss calls if in noisy environment    
Nice Mobile and Super Camera No.1 Performance  Superb Display Quality Totally I like very much this Mobile    
Good phone with out any lag while playing high capacity games.I received it with in one day, thanks to flipkart.  Pros : 1.Good screen clarity 2. Good or i can say best camera 3. Less heating issue. 4. Design is repeated but it's almost good in hand ; so slim-sexy body. 5. Smooth touch. 6. Good procy.  Cons: 1.Small data cable ; low quality headset. 2. Battery backup not too good. 3. Ram is quite low. 4. Speaker sound quality is low  But i can say if you set your mind to buy samsung j7 then must go for it because it's samsung :) with very impressive camera even front cam can beat other phone's camera thanks to samsung.     
I've purchased the phone for my college going son and on his recommendation. But we feel a bit let down by the low sound level of the phone. Due to this one even can't depend on the alarm set on this phone. The AMOLED display as shown in the specs/features is also not impressive. Seems an average phone with high hype created by SAMSUNG. Needs improvements in these two fronts for sure.    
Definitely an awesome mobile at this price. Overall good performance without any lags. Must say that the features provided at this price range are just amazing.. Superb camera quality, Light weighted, Nice display, looks great, smooth touch, fast charging and d battery is awesome with power saving n ultra-power saving modes.  However, I feel that the audio output is average and ya the charging cable is too short but otherwise its an amazing phone. Last but not least, thank u flipkart for such a fast delivery. It was a gift for my wife and she loves it :)    
Even after a replacement, the SIM 1 kept repeatedly disconnecting. It was a repeated irritation which had bad consequences to me on a big level. Poor speed. RAM gets jammed frequently. When compared with android lollipop, samsung lollipop is OK. But Kitkat 4.4.2 was the best and most flexible OS of samsung. Samsung, please improve your OS quality. You have an unique fan base. You are now spoiling it your self. Please make improvements.  Overall: Its an OK phone with a few defects.    
Thanks to flipkart for the fast delivery.  About the Phone: 1.Excellent Display(Amoled Display is using in this phone) 2.Camera is Superb. 3.Speed is Very Good, no lagging 4.Battery life is very good and fast charging. 5.Touch is impressive. 6.Decent Loud speaker  Disadvantages. 1.No gorilla glass protection. 2.No water resistance  In my opinion this is the best mid range phone. I am pleased with the performance. Go for it,Good value for money.     
I HAD PURCHASED J7, BUT SIM 1 CANT SHOW SIGNAL BAR,SO I REPLACE WITH THE NEW ONE AGAIN SAME ISSUE WAS DER. I THINK MANUFACTURING DEFECT WITH J7, WTH ALL HANDSETS    
this phone is great with great specifications  13mp back , 5 mp front camera , with good picture quality long lasting battery,  no heating even when excessive use doesnot hangs  nice RAM   nice 5.5 AMOLED DISPLAY  NICE SOUND QUALITY  A GOOD PHONE FROM SAMSUNG WORTH TO BUY AT 15K    
I am using this mobile last one month. Look of this mobile is excellent. this is perfect in this prize range.  But be careful with airtel offers as they have not provided me double data after number of complents    
Nice Battery back up 5/5 Screen quality is good. 4.5/5 Camera Quality is very good 5/5 User interface old but very convenient 4.5/5      
1. no led notification - u will have to keep checking ur phone for any messages/calls. Same thing for charging 2. speaker is tiny any very very low - get ready to miss a few calls ! 3. 13mp camera quality - i bought this phone reading the camera reviews but trust me its just clicks like any 8mp camera  what i loved about this phone is the battery life. After using a a good number of Samsung phones, i found this one above all with the battery lasting me more than a day with internet pack on. Rest all running fine yet. A good buy but speaker quality and missing led notifications pissed me off big time      
Definitely a good product at this price. I pre booked it on 25th of july and got it on 29th of august.  Pros: 1. The battery is good and it takes 2.20 hrs to fully charge. 2. Storage is also good and it's allow to expand up to 128 GB. 3. Processor is so fast, apps are installing/uninstalling in a blink and switching between  apps are so smooth and fast.  4. Super amoled gives excellent clarity to pictures and videos. 5. 13 MP rear camera is good and fast in it's segment. 6. Front camera is also good and auto focus helps to take good pictures in low light. 7. The in-built smart manager feature is new and nice.  Cons.: 1. RAM should be at least 2 GB. 2. No in-built music player is disappointing. 3. Missing the multi window feature. 4. WS retailer didn't mentioned in specification that only indian SIM card can be use.  Overall the product is so good in this range but I am facing sometime the device is not restarting after hitting the restart button and i need to remove the battery and turned it on all the time. One more problem is the sound seems broken sometimes and I need to restart the device to fix it.    
you can buy this phone it is running with a vey good speed and there is no need of taking suggestions from any one about this phone    
very nice calling voice. display is best. music sound little bit low but OK. video camera best. all over best product in 14999 from best company    
After two days of usage....  Brilliant response in touch,  Audio quality is not so good, Loudspeaker volume is low, missed few calls.  Missing features like screen mirroring, audio player etc... Camera quality is excellent Android 5 ! but few features are missing when compared with other brands with similar versions.  Battery backup is extraordinary. No hang up's, no heating issues.  Good buy with a budget of 15k...     
Review from a Samsung's Advanced customer having around 15 Samsung devices(includes my family member devices)  I would like to share some of the Positive and Negative things of Samsung Galaxy J7 from my point of view.  +Ve  1)Excellent Display 2)Processor Speed is Good 3)Slim Device 4)Good Camera for the price 5)Power Saving mode available 6)Ultra Power Saving mode also available 7)Good for browsing 8)Battery back is good 9)Out of 16gb available internal memory for user is approx 11.5gb.  -Ve  1)No Samsung link App. 2)No DLNA feature. 3)No Auto light sensor feature (Essential feature for a Smartphone in this price). 4)Advanced Audio codes are not supported while playing videos even if i installed MX player. 5)If you have smart TV, u cannot stream or share any videos/photos using this phone. 6)Sound quality(Ringtone Volume) is low 7)Headphone quality is very bad  I think rest of the features are discussed very well by other buyers too.  This is a king of phone for normal users or for users new to Andriod usage.  If you are a advanced user stay away from this phone.  The right price for this phone should be 10k to 13k considering competitors phones.  15K is costly for the above said features.    
pic quality is very awesome.... over all mughe bahut pasand aaya,, thoda sa problm ye h ki charging cable chota h aur earphone bird wala nhe diya h,,, if u r music lover then u have to invest more money for new earphone,,  over all the best,,,, Thnku samsung ; flipkart.    
well i pre register the phone n i get phone at 14000, why to purchase this phone? pros:- 1) awsam batter - it will last upto 15 to 17 hr or use with 3g network all time with moderate usage, it have power saving mode and ultra power shaving mode too. 2) its UI touch wiz is soo colourfull its looks so good so beautifull. 3) its being 15 day i dint get any major lag, game play is so great. 4) its support otg, dual sim, dual flash n dint heat while playing game. 5) its SAR rating is very low unexpectedly.   cons:- 1) its dose not have its own music player it give google play. 2) quite heavy unevenly.  n except i dint have any complain love this phone better then lenovo k3 and that 10000 range phones totally satisfied with the prize.    
Overall its a good product with.. nice features...   Advantages.... Battery.... Processing.... Performance.....  Cons... Sound... Ringtone... Too low..    
it performs like a beast .....no lag or frame drops even while playing high end games. good camera with superb display and it feels comfortable in hand ,battery is awesome with power saving n ultra-power saving modes.audio output is average bt good clarity.go 4 it!!!    
SIMPLY AWESOME PROS: SOUND: Yes, SOUND. It has been much hyped that the sound of J7 is so low that you are going to miss calls. It is wrong. I got the mobile on 04-9-15 and till date I have not missed a single call even in busy marketplace. The voice quality is crisp and clear. IT IS LOUDER THAN SONY MOBILES. CAMERA: Camera is awesome even at night (even without flash).Overall camera performance is good both rear and front. SCREEN: Picture quality is superb and 267 ppi seems to be low on paper but in the real world it is quite good. BATTERY: Lasts all day even after exhaustive use.(video, music net surfing, calling) NETWORK: Network receptivity is great on both SIM1 AND SIM2.NO ISSUES AT ALL. OTG: Yes it supports OTG. INTERNET: Got speeds up to 11.5 mbps download speed and 6.7 mbps upload speed on 3g network in Bhagalpur, Bihar on Aircel 3g.And similar speeds over wifi networks. NO ISSUES AT ALL. RAM: It is nicely optimised and SMART MANAGER IS GREAT. CONS (MANAGEABLE): DATA CABLE: Around six inches short. You can buy a longer cable from the market. MUSIC PLAYER: No default music player. You can download from play store. GALLERY: No gallery as before. You can select sort by ALBUM instead of TIME. You will get same view as before. CONS (NON-MANAGEABLE): SENSORS: Missing E-COMPASS. Though I don’t use it much still I am missing it. AVI: It does not recognise AVI FILES.THOUGH YOU CAN PLAY AVI FILES VIA MX PLAYER OR VLC PLAYER BUT YOU CANNOT PLAY IT DIRECTLY FROM FILE MANAGER.     
Indeed an awesome phone by Samsung after a long time. Overall nice performance without any lags and super speed performance while app download.Features provided within this kind of price amazed me.  I don't know why people are complaining on low volume as the volume is at par with any other phone. I guess initially when the phone is received , inside the back cover there is a small net sticker to protect it from dust. People are not removing it while using.That is why they are saying so.If you remove that sticker the volume is absolutely clear.Hope this will help.     
Bought this one from flipkart after its launch,Phone is Fantastic for this price.  My Short Review  Pros 1.Feels Premium 2.Lightweight 3.Fantastic Touch Screen(UI) 4.4G 5.Blazing fast Responsiveness  6.New Gen Ram 7.Both Rear and Front cam  8.Build 9.Super AMOLED HD Display  Cons- 1.Charging Cable too Short 2.Only 1.5 gb Ram(but being new gen ram it does the job)  Other than that the phone is fantastic,And it doesn't pinch your pocket too much if u want a phone which feels like a premium.. I would say go for it...you wont regret it....     
Excellent Display, Good battery Life. Good sound. Headphone is not good enough if you connect in ear headphone then it produce a very good sound effect. Some times it hangs while switching Apps other wise its a Good phone at all.    
No Wonder .. i booked this phone based on the specifications on 21st July and got Delivered on 24th August..it was pre Order and almost waited for 1 month. once i got the delivery the mobile it self is a wonder..  every thing was Just amazing.. Look, Feel.. was Grate.. In past I used Galaxy Grand Duos which there was a Lag in every action. Thanks to Samsung it did a great Job. Super Amoled Screen. Now I have purchased 3 Samsung J7 mobiles for my family.  why to waste money 40-60K on premium phones instead can go with this phone with ou any Hesitation    
I bought this phone, looking at the reviews from others who had bought this phone, so there are a lot of positives mentioned in these reviews and my personal pro's are the phone is very fast, extremely light and great display. Latest andriod OS is sweet.  One of my concerns is with the speaker, it is very low, you will not be able to hear the phone ring as well. Hope Samsung recalls this model and provides us with a J7 having better speakers.    
This is an amazing phone by Samsung after a long time in budget price. The only set back is that the ringer volume is a bit low and the front flash light is annoying. But overall it is a wonderful phone. Go for it.    
ordered it on 1 sep get it today at amritsar everything is jus amazing about this product screen, camera ,touch 5 stars, only problem i never got AIRTEL 4 sim along with that    
It is an awesome phone to buy in this price. It has an awesome battery bckup and gaming experience is also good in this phone. It only lacks in the sound. It does not have good speakers.    
Its the king in the 15k range.many brands like mi,yuphoria,meizu,lumia,moto etc are availabe in the market but this one is certainly far ahead in the race with many striking features put in it n brand value matters a lot too..guys if you are looking for a phone under 15k thn your search ends here .get this oneand you will fall in love wid it ..n remember it loves you back..get this one.    
Pros: 1.Camera: Image quality is good. No blurring occurred even for moving objects. Even in low light, the image quality is acceptable Good for selfies. 2. Processing: Played multiple games like Asphalt 8, Spiderman, etc for 1-2 hours continuously and the battery didn't get overheated, a major plus point. 3. Battery life: Can survive without charging it for 2 days, with normal usage i.e. calls, facebook chats, music and videos(1 hour) without a sweat. 4. Look: For people who are looking for style quotient of the handset will not be disappointed. Its slim and has less weight. 5. Screen quality: Can watch FullHD (1080P) videos with clear frames. 6. Value for money: Worth buying. Period.  Cons: Yet to encounter one.

Received order in 21 Hours without fast delivery option!! Awesome.. Thanks Flipkart! This is an immediate replacement of my Lumia, who just got retired after a long service..RIP.. Choose it after long research for Gaming, Pics, Battery, Reliability..  My first Android..Galaxy J7 is good in all the specs mentioned. Liked Camera, front and rear both are nice. Super Amoled display is good. Games are running smooth, no lags till now, 5.5 inches HD view of games, superb. Battery backup is ok, but facing an issue with battery charging, the status is not appropriately shown, charging was strucked twice at 49% and 79%, but when i tried removing battery and restarting the phone it showed battery 100%. This may be an issue, will get in touch for battery replacement if this repeats. Regarding volume, yeah it's low, but hoping Samsung will comeup with few updates to resolve it. Rest all is good.    
Must buy phone............  1) Great graphics 2) Gr8 Speed 3) Good Quality Cameras 4) 4G connectivity 5) No Heating Prob Truely an Awesome Phone in buget . alas i missed the flip cover offer

This model is very nice and has a good config but the back cover is very fragile.so it has to be handled with care but rest everything is great ,so go for it.    
First Thanks to FlipKart.

The phone was delivered today morning. This is my 2nd Samsung Product..so reviewing after checking all its specifications. To start with, The phone is an absolute GEM in case of specification within this price range. PROS: 1. Battery backup is very good 2. 5.5 inches AMOLED screen is the main point of attraction. 3. There is no question of hanging as it is having Exynos Octacore Processor with 1.5Ghz speed 4. Camera is simply awsom both front and rear with flash. 5. Android Lollipop  6 1.5gb RAM with Octacore Processor is a good combination. Wuld hav been better if it was 2 GB  Cons: Cord Length is short Phone is bit heavy bit it can be ignored. Back cover is bit thin.   Overall it was an excellent purchase in this price range.    
Best Phone In this Range!! Yep I agreed Built Quality is not so good. but The Sleek Design ; Performance is Very Decent. Although Both Camera's Is Eye Catching! According To The Samsung Phone's that will be The Great Built Product with Most Decent Features in it.  I'd Like to thank #Flipkart For Giving Me Discount On This Product For Too Much Delay. And also wanna Thank The Ekart Delivery Person Named ;Saif; which Had Good Gestures About to delivered My area! Thanks You #Flipkart.  Don't Think too much guys. Go for it    
Really nyc phone grt battery back up..  back only one drawback no back button ..  need to check the performance after ten days ..  if your budget is below 15k best ph ..go for it. no heating hugging issue.looks like s4 ...  cheers naveen.k    
i recived my phone on 22th august.. truly nice phone, battery backup is awesome nd performance is also very good...    
Order phone in one day guarantee, got within 20 hours.  When saw the J7 mobile, really satisfied for this mobile for 15k. Thanks Samsung have a good product like it.  I don't find any disadvantages.    
It is really excellent product by Samsung at very reasonable price. Feeling happy to have this mobile Only problem, it is having low volume of ringtone.    
its more than a day since i got it in my hands. Just loving it. Its too fast and extremly smooth. a bit big for me but its amazing to see videos in the super amoled screen.  very satisfied and the best phone i have used it now.     
Nice product from Samsung once again and it is fast phone, my 24 hours experience is here  Pros. 1.Great Display  2.Speed is good 3.Good Battery life 4.Fast charging 5.Good touch experience 6.Big asset of front flash for selfie lovers for front camera  Cons: 1. Frankly say this camera is not good back 13Mp and front 5Mp is not good,  2.In low light camera was not at all good this price range, i use galaxy s2, s3 3.Galaxy S2 8Mp camera is better than Galaxy j7 4.Sound is low 5.No backlight for buttons 6.Main Disadvantage is Lake of Gorilla glass protection 7.Back door also very thin 8.Low PPI 267  This is my experience of 24hours used experience of Galaxy J7, It is true about phone    
All other features are same as other models from Samsung. I was excited about from 5mp camera with flash, however the quality of pictures that this 5mp takes is very poor. Also, quality of pictures primary camera takes is super poor. I would suggest not to buy this, nothing new, in fact have lower down in terms of camera quality.    
nice mobile from samsung.display quality is awsome...best mobile for 15k...blindly go for this battery-10/10 back camera-10/10 front camera-6/10 display-10/10 sound-6/10     
thanks to flipkart for rapid delivery ordered on saturday and they deliverd on monday  1. dispay is v good  2. no leggy  3. running 3g idea data pack that's running superb  4. rear camera quality is too good with 13mp  5. battery life is OK so far      
Hello,  Review is too long but you will find very useful.  Thanks to Flipkart for deliver Samsung J7 Finally only within 48 hours after shipping.  Thanks to WS Retailer also.  I am first user of Samsung J7 in Surat city. This phone is already launched in July-15, I pre-booked this phone on 17 July and Flipkart did wrong promises often times to delivered before 10 August. I got this phone on 23 August 2015.  Review about phone.  Battery - 5/5 Phone look is good and slim. 3000 MAH Battery cool.  Processor - 3/5 1.5 GB + Exynos 7580, OctaCore Processor but I did not find Exynos description on Samsung Box.  I bought this phone for gaming and yesterday I have installed Asphalt 8 ,Modern Combat 5 and GT Racing 2 from GAMELOFT which are free for Samsung J7. but this all game did not working.   Very much Dissatisfy with J7 Processor because this phone is launched for Gaming and no game which are provided by J7 is not working.  Camera : 3/5 Front Camera is not too good compare to Grand Prime. Not even automatic palm detect facility provided and very less mode compare to this range others phones.  Screen : 5/5 Screen is superb as all Samsung Brand.  OS : Lolipop 5.1.1 Awsome for use. 5/5  Sometimes there is network issue. Speaker is also good.   So guys if you want to play game like mentioned above or provided by J7 then don't go for this phone.  Or for others use then Go for it.  Thanks, Ankit     
Nice product from Samsung  Pros. 1. Great Display  2. Fast speed 3. Excellent Battery life (Removable 3000 MAh battery) 4. Fast charging 5. Good touch experience 6. Front flash 7. No heating/hanging after using a week.  Cons: 1. Rear Camera disappoints in low light 2. No back light for buttons 3. Low PPI 4. Samsung Music software is not available    
Super Cool Product for Super Cool price ! I got this product yesterday and reviewed it thoroughly.  The interface is very good and really felt amazed with the functionality of following features:- * Speed * Display (5.5;) * Interface * Wifi Direct Feature * In built 16 GB is quite promising too...  That too for a price of 15000 is super cool. Samsung Brand is kindly of reliable...    
Got this for my Mom, myself using moto X(1st gen) from 14 months. wud like to let tell u the very specific things that tempt me to buy for self..  Amoled (sharp, vibrant ) : viewing pleasure as good/better than Full HD LCD Removable 3000 MAh battery (my moto X doesnt have...) Expandable to 128 gb (stuck with 11.8 GB internal on my X...otg is temporary soln) its samsung (good service ... can be sure of getting repaired instead of use and throw). All Accessories available ...even with roadside vendors...gr8 Gr8 Camera... need it many times ... cant carry my bulky DSLR everywhere  cons: Mom u probably will miss calls n notifications due to low speaker volume no notification LED Also no water resistance (atleast I need it)    
This is my best phone till now and the best thing is it's in very good price range overall 5/5   Camera is too good now hangs problem  no heating   highly recommended  You will be happy after purchase this phone    
recvd phone after long waiting to add in cart. music software is not available in this phone. yet to try more as recvd today only.    
THIS MOBLIE IS SO GOOD I HAVE EVER PURCHASED EVERY THING IN THIS MOBLIE IS EXCELLENT ONLY THE MISSING THING IS NOTIFICATION light only     
Same day Mobile Hang and 13MP Camera Quality is very Poor...........................................................    
After using 3 days m writing this, this is the best phone you will get for 15k with some great features.   Rear Camera is too good 5/5 Front Camera 3/5 but ok Better battery 5/5 no hangs problem 5/5 no heating 5/5  I suggest blindly go for this.    
just received samsung galaxy j7 phone from flipkart after very long wait. I was eagerly waiting for this phone. after using 3/4 days i would like to review the phone  pros 1. its a masterpiece from samsung in the price range15k 2. amoled display is very crystal clear. 3. interface is also very good 4. battery life is also adequate. 5. camera is very fine. picture comes very sharp. 6. touch screen is very smooth 7.loooks also very great.  i dont find any cons in this phone. definately i strongly prefer this phone under 15k. it is of worth money. definately go for it.    
Pros :  - Battery - Camera - Display - Sound - No hang/heating problem after using 15+ days  Cons:   - RAM (1.5 GB) , you can get 2 GB RAM in other phone for this range, But you won't get above pros in those.     
Hello frriends i have purchased this phone 2 weeks ago.Flipkart delivered it in 5-6 day.I wish to say that it is a superb phone which is worth 25000 according to me.I will tell you why ....  Pros- 1. The display is awesome....Its Super amoled which is best in class.... colours are vivid and brightness is too good.....i coudnt ind any diference in full hd display o note 3 and this one of hd 720p 2. It comes with a decent 13 mp camera but dont judge it by whats shown on the screen.....the display is so nice that it will show even a dull image as vibrant and colourfull. Capture an image transfer it on your laptop or PC then you will see the actuall image quality.But its good for a 15000 phone..... 3.Battery backup is more than good ....i m a heavy user and the battery lasts for about 1 and a half day.....no problem related to battery till now.... 4. Processor is very fast and no problem or speed issue .I have tried heavy apps and full hd videos , no problem.Dont look at the specs on paper....it will give better speed than many 3 gb ram running samsung phones and will not lag even a single time........i m surprised.... 5. Front Led flash is a wow .... 6. Touchwiz UI is very improved and very pleasant to look at...  Cons-  Only 1 or 2 that is it doesnt has gorilla glass and relies only on google play music .No samsung music player by default.....  Overall better than Galaxy S5 and Note 3 , Moto G , Moto X2 , Mi4i , Samsung A5 . A7 .....  It has dual sim and you can enjoy dual sim and micro sd card both at the same time ....not like A5 or A7 in which u can use either dual sim or 1 sim with memory card .... It supports 4G .... It runs latest android 5.1 lollipop flavour ....  go for it ......just 15000.....    
I was a note 2 user and got this phone which is having almost same specifications. Writing this review using it for more than three weeks..  Things i like are in the mobile 1. Price - very reasonable 2. Slim n good looking 3. Touch n display are very nice 4. Camera fastness is superb but the quality is just fine. 5. Very fast (not as fast as note 2) - Haven't seen any lag when using multiple applications till date.  cons: 1. Sound quality is too low I am sure you will definitely miss few calls when you are outside. 2. No LED indicator for notifications. 3. No background lights for hardkeys    
The ringtone and music quality is worst.... but I like the camera quailty and screen display very much on this phone.    
Thanks to flipkart for its quick delivery, not that quick though....I ordered it on 24rth eve and received th product on 28th noon...n this is my 7 days experience wid the phone... Pros: A good processor Descent battery life and fast charging (my phone gets 0-100% charged in around 2.5 hrs Sleek design easy to carry inspite of its 5.5 inch screen Sharp screen Back n front camera perform well but lacks Color reproduction in low light No lags till now...even during heavy gaming..I tried asphalt 8 wid the best settings possible n it was quite smooth Touch is impressive Front flash makes a good sense for selfie lovers Cons: Lack of screen protection A bit heavy though u won't feel it coz of its sleek design Sound is poor...I missed calls often when am at crowdy areas Ram's less...also lollipop is a ram hungry os...so 1.5gb (630mb approx. User available) isn't that enough...though the processor makes it a no lag phone Lack of gyro sensor..which is necessary for a good gaming experience n also compass Lack of backlit physical buttons.  Note: the back cover is not that much cheap in reality as much it appears in the images.... :p  Verdict: a must buy phn made by Samsung in terms of processor, display, camera etc. Super smooth n m loving it...      
This mobile is working good. Battery backup is very nice. Also having Ultra power saving mode. I love Knox app in this phone. which provide a seperate work area for user.    
Nice product from Samsung both J5 ; J7 only the screen size matters, camera quality is also decent, equipped with both rear ; front camera flashes, 4G supported handset that comes in handy around 15k. Still waiting to find out its cons since it just hit market and I bought it.    
Good Picture Quality ,  Easy to handle  Nice look ; comfortable.    
if u want to buy this fon go for it without thinking anything else.I am using this fon since 1 week and experienced no issue and nor will i. first of all battery performance is too good i am heavy user and i get 1.5days battery life.charging of the fon is also fast 1.5hrs are needed to charge from 0-100% . camera is superb both front and rear . if u have extra lens for fons u will njoy clicking picta especially micro. music quality with headphones are okay not best as sony. hardware of this fon is best and it will not be laggy. 1.5gb ram will b working as smooth as 2gb ram mobiles. Some reviews are against the loud speaker but it is loud for me bcas i was using sony so its far better for me. I also have samsung j5 both models works like charm.  Conclusion- GO FOR IT    
Advantages:  Light weight and slim design. Phone has good battery backup and it also charges fast ... Very shrap and vibrant colour display ..thanks to super amoled. Camera is also awesome with natural colour display. Speaker quality is superb...best by samsung till date.  Disadvantages:  Back panel is so flexible not of good quality. Quality of earphones is not as expected. No led notification light. Ram should have been 2GB.  overall decent phone from samsung better than moto g3     
hi all on 24th july ive order this phone and got finally on 25th aug. so far so good  before this ive used moto g and yureka must tell you this phone is really beat all cheap handset super camera super battery super personalization built quality  must but product .......     
Really a great phone from Samsung............... I do had many doubt about the UI of samsung which has been prone to be very laggy....  but this one comes with a new UI which is absolutely lag free.Very happy with the phone.. Also i should mention that Flipkart delivered the item very fast.I got the item 3 days before xpected delivery.  Coming to phone it comes with latest version of android and thanks for the octacore Exynos 7580 taht is clocked at 1.5GHz.It supports LTE (found in many of the phones in this range). The in hand feel of the phone is simply awesome.......... its slim body looks quite premium. Camara is just OK (am not a PHOTO FREAK......so dsnt matter to me). Gaming is awesome on this phone. No matter which game u throw at it, this phone handles them with ease. The sound quality on the phone is great. Yes, the sound is not too high but it is audible. Many mentioned this as an CON but i dont think so.........The display is XCELLENT inspite of low PPI.  Next comes the powerful 3000 mAh battery which lasts for more than one day even for a power user.Thanks for the Power saving and Ultra Power Saving Modes. Also the phone gets charged quickly. Also the phone supports OTG and u can connect ur pendrive, so that u need not have to save HUGE files in the phone. The only annnoying thing is that it dont have multi window support inspite of huge display. Also it dosent have auto brightness, compass and other sensors that are commonly present on other phones (even in low range devices) which i personally never use.But Samsung should not have skipped them. Also there is no secondary noice cancellation mic. inspite of the absence of the above features the phone s superb. Inspite of the absence of compass the Navigation on maps is quite accurate. Overall an excellent phone in this price range.If u r looking for a PREMIUM phone in BUDGET range then J7 is the best option available now.    
i m facing heating issue while using internet for watssap, messenger etc also whie playing games even having octacore processor. phone gets heated enough while charging.    
Delivered on the same day with the same day delivery option. I was stunned with display quality, photo quality. Battery charging is rapid and draining rate too. White is stunning with white cover. Cash on delivery option is superb. Initially i had sim card detection problem but after changing the sim problem solved. No hanging problem like in other androids, no heating problems, more user friendly.    
Pros -Nice Display -Good battery life -Good Camera -Fast Charging -No lagging/hanging  Cons -The biggest drawback is low speaker volume. At most of the times ringtone is inaudible. -No LED for notification -No gorilla glass protection      
What I liked- Its a viewers delight as far as the videos are concerned.. Music on the headphones are nice.. It works very smoothly.. Battery backup is good.. Rest is average..  What I hated- It's speakers are very bad...u won't be able to hear it even if u r sitting in ur room...  Overall its a good set and i would happily suggest my dear ones to go for it except for the speaker issue...  Note- I m writing this after 4-5 days of my usage...    
its getting struck automatically, turning off, going into programming mode, waste of money  please dont go for it.    
first of all thank you flipkart to fast delivery ...come to mobile im so confused to buy which mobile then i decided to buy moto g 3 gen (16gb) but out of stock already waiting for 2 weeks gone then oly i decided to buy samsung galaxy J7 it was good feature and looking so gud then i love this mobile .....but three disadvantage is there  1.no button background light. 2.no notification light.. 3.RAM 1.5 but ok to use this memory... any way no doubt to buy this mobile awesome mobile..........    
++++++++Its a big mobile, attractive display, no hanging even playing 50mb games, Battery comes upto 28 hours,charging faster(2 hours for 100%), ,... ---------------Not with special features, No face scan screen lock, No NFC, Sound also Ok not that much, No locks for applications, Camera OK not super, Back door is plastic,..    
The Samsung Galaxy J7 is very fast device. I have played HD games to test the speed. It never hangs. It is always ready to perform any task. It's so fast. 16 GB memory is very cool to install huge no of AAPs.   Camera quality is very good. Some people says that- the cameras are not good. Actually to take perfect picture you have to touch the object which you want to focus. Then the camera automatically sets focus to that particular object; and takes perfect photo.Front and Back flash are very powerful. Full-HD video quality is awesome.   Sound volume is very low. But sound quality is good.  GPU is very powerful. Can play Full HD, Blue-ray movies easily.  Duel 4G sim slot can handle 2G, 3G or 4G sim efficiently.   I recommend this.    
hi  The review is a bit long but you will it usefull.thanks to flipkart for deliver it fast. thnks to ws retailer also. the bad thing about flipkart is i did not received a airtel 4g sim. i also tell this problem to flipkart customer service but they were not able to fix it.  review about phone -  This phone is very light weight and it feels good while it is in your hand the curves re perfect it handles smoothly.  display 4\5  it is brillant the colours are best when you play heavy games on it display will be awesome thanks to super amoled screen and its 5.5 inch size. but not full rating because ppi is bit low.but its good when you will use it you will feel its better than any mid range phone in market better than moto g3 and also have outdoor brightness.   processor 5\5   the processor is best faster. butter smooth i bought this phone for gaming and it is running asphalt8, morden combat x,gt racing 2 very very smoothly.with exynos 7580 it is stable all games re stable not even a hang or lang while playing heavy games i swear to god. its processor is best in its mid range phone. better than moto g3 and lenovo a6000+.  camera 4\5   the clearity is good and resolution is also 13 mp. selfie re best with front facing flash.   battery   it lasts long more than two days. 3000mh battery   speaker 3\5   the sounds re clear. but it is not very loud.   os 5\5   its lolipop   ram 5\5   dont thing that ram is low so it will hang or lag its a good kind of stuff i knew it from smart prix its fast.   if you re gamer or movie watcher web user go for this. and dont waste your hardearn money on that stupid lenovo a6000+.   thnks   eshu

I am writing this review after 15 days. Overall this phone is good if you are looking for 4G but unfortunately I couldn't test the 4G because Fraud airtel is providing 3g services and 3g recharge on 4G network in Delhi.  Airtel didn't given me double data offer. They are keep saying that you not activated the offer and some are saying you have to upload the document, IMEI etc. on Airtel website then only you will get Double data offer.  I activated the airtel double data offer yet my money got wasted on the other side there is no need to activate such kind of offer in Vodafone. Just recharge and get double data.  Airtel and Samsung mutually cheating the peoples.   Second problem in this phone which I found is back side speaker. So you always have to put your phone on desk. Never put on bed otherwise you couldn't hear the ring of the phone.  Third problem, the consumed memory again and again got increased by 75%, doesn't matter whether you use gmail or whatsapp. If you just open the application, the memory percentage will reach 75-80%.  Camera quality is good according to price. Rest all thing is fine except it's too much heavy then other phones.    
it hangs as normally and battery backup is very slow and sound is also very low  15k is not a recomonded price   speaker sound is also very low      
It is an excellent phone with good battery backup, better display quality, practically very slim. the only problem is that it only have 1.5 gb of ram out of which 50% is always taken by the os. and i have also experienced a little heating problem below the rear camera. overall it is the best smartphone at 15k by samsung    
product is superb !! and good !! also delivery service are good !!  thanks u so much flipkart !!  if u want purchase good mobile in this price then J7 is awesome !!    
Great phone in 15000/k. Sound little low, but overall phone is the best. Thanks to Samsung ; Flipkart.    
It is a very nice mobile. I am using this mobile for last 10 days.Awesome mobile. Battery is good. Browsing speed is superb as it has octacore and 1.5 gb RAM.    
i purchaged this mobile by the flipkart this are reliable price but its not good for whose people talk much more and talking purpose, because its sound quality is too low and need to listen very carefully by the speaker also its happen buzz in back site like speaker is below in back site and all are empty in this phone so back cover is vibrating , also for ringing volume and song sound quality is too low after then have full volume in this phone .    all are ok like camera is fantastic and every thing is good , only sound quality and mike quality is noot good also have to speak in loud because opposite person cant listen if you speak slowly slowly . so don't purchase if you purchasing this mobile for talking purpose . i swear its being with me so will not recommend to purchase to any other person for talking purpose .    
At present I am satisfied with this Galaxy J7. Quality of snaps/Selfie by front camera is nice. In this price of Rs. 14,999/- more so when it is a Samsung product, purchasing J7 would not be a wrong deal. Perhaps, there is no other mobile handset available in the market to compete with J7 in this economical price if performance and specification as a whole is checked. Thanks Nannu as you suggested me to buy this mobile handset Galaxy J7.    
After using Moto G, Moto E and Asus 5, I am back to Samsung. They clearly are not as well built like Motorola Phones but their repair is cheap and spares are easily available. With Motorolas, your love will be over with them as soon as you break your Gorilla Glass screen.   Talking about Samsung Galaxy J7, everything is good apart from their front camera clarity and low speaker sound.    
m having problem in recording videos in samsung j7....... always show warning of recording failed....    
I have been using this phablet for last 3 weeks now. Looks are awesome , its thin, but you can not put it in pocket if you are wearing a jeans. Works hassle free, no lags or hanging, touch is smooth. It does not has backlight for auxiliary touch switches, no auto brightness control which may be a little tedious if you keep moving in dark places to open frequently. As for me I am a office goer, no field job so autobrightness is no issue for me. Camera is good with very bright flash.  Overall a good phone from Samsung at a good price.    
I like everything about this phone except the speaker sound is pretty low. Otherwise good buy. One star less for the low sound.    
I got this phone in just 4 days after my order. Phone is really good. I am happy with this. Camera and touch really nice. sound is little slow but overall phone is great.    
Good product  Pros  Software 9/10 5.1 Speed 8/10 It's fast. Design 8/10 Sleek A/V 8/10 In-built player plays almost all the file types. Battery 9/10 Runs for 2-3 days once fully charged (with wi-fi) Price 9/10 Very good buy at this price.  Cons  Earphone 3/10 Disappointed (Uneven left-right combination, left is too short) Hardware 6/10 (Found one loose screw at the back. Had to fix it manually) Screen 7/10 (Not scratch resistant) Size 6/10 Cant operate with one hand.  PS if your a/v files are not playing and showing an error, make sure you fully download the file, not parts 80%, 99%,otherwise it wont play, No matter whatever player you download from app store.    
Great Features in Low Price... Just Love This Phone in every manner... Looks, Features.. everything is just osm... Have a Try...    
Everything in this device is brilliant, The volume is quite low but still its loud enough to hear it while driving a motorcycle in public places.    
THE PHONE IS OVERALL VERY GUD..LUK IS GOOD..DISPLAY IS GOOD BT SOUND COULD HAVE BEEN A BIT LOUDER...OTHERWISE THE PHONE IS A WORTH BUY....    
This phone is worth every penny that you pay for it.I have been using the phone for the last 15 days.According to me some of the awesome feature of galaxy j7 are - 1)It has Exynos 7580 octa core processor which has been made by samsung itself hence it coordinate every task either gaming or some light weighted task very well. 2)No lag while playing even high graphics game such as Asphalt 8,Nova 3,Modern combat6 etc even with their highest configuaration. 3)Awesome back cam(13 MP) as well as front cam(which comes with flash also typically for selfie lover). 4)Samsung inbuilt smart manager which clean system within second. 5)Battery backup is astonishing.While playing games for 3-4 hr,it hardly drop from 100 to 70%. some of its cons are- 1)Cheap back cover. 2)No led notification 3)Speaker volume is not upto the mark.  Overall it's an awesome mid range smartphone introduced by samsung.And it will further enhance the samsung market in mid range smartphone.It's a must buy phone for everyone...    
This is a best phone at this price range which was introduced by Samsung. This phone doesn't hang at all,doesn't heat at all and the 3d quality of this set is awsome which makes the set best FOR games. The only issues is that very lower sound produced by the j7. I love this very much.

Processor - 5/5 1.5 GB + Exynos 7580, OctaCore Processor but I did not find Exynos description on Sa… (Expand) 1.Great Display  2.Speed is good 3.Good Battery life 4.Fast charging 5.Good touch experience 6.Big asset of front flash for selfie lovers for front camera     
I had a moto g2 , so it seemed an upgrade for me ,and i m happy wid the product I love the screen ,too good for watching movies and videos on the go , thanks to the 3000mah battery  It looks better than the mi 4i and moto g3   The Camera is decent and the front flash is a life saver  The touch is very responsive and the phone doesnt lag  There are a few cons too  The System takes around 600 mb of the ram :( ... No goriilla glass ...But a tempered glass will do  The sound is a little less but mangeable  So if are ok with all dese , this is the perfect phone     
VERY GOOD PHONE CAMERA IS VERY GOOD GOOD DISPLAY QUALITY BEST PHONE AT THIS PRICE FOR SAMSUNG BRAND FLIPKART PROVIDED GOOD SERVICE    
Till date, my impression on this phone is satisfactorily good. Have been using the phone for a week, but haven't use extensively.  The performance has been good so far. How good it continues to perform in extensive use will be revealed in the long run.  1. Battery life is very good, charging is very fast. 2. Apps are running smoothly, no hanging yet. 3. Camera is good, could have been better, both back and front, even for this price. At least the back camera. Still, i can say it is okay as a personal opinion. Camera functioning is very good. 4. Tested some music playing, missed the default music player. Hope to adjust with the Google Play Music. 5. Awesome Display, cant find anything better than it in this price range, and even a little above range as well. 6. Built-in games are all demo. It is very bad as after 5 trials, each having only 3 minutes, there is no way to play the game. You need to download the full game for Rs. 50 each, which I think is a loss, since those games weren't even A-list games. 7. Video are running good. Except the mobile don't know what AVI is. Samsung should have taught that to this phone. 8. Haven't tried OTG yet. But it supports OTG, as far as I know, which is a very good feature. 9. Size of the phone and screen are big enough. Despite that, it is easy to hold. Optimum size. 10. The storage capacity is HUGE. 16GB device storage + External Memory Card up to maximum 128GB. 11. 1.5GB RAM; should have been 2GB. 12. No heating issue till date.   Never liked buying phones online. But liked the features of this phone so much, that I had to go for it. You wont get another phone like this at such low price.      
i used this product for 5 days now. the display and battery backup is good but the camera is very bad , my old grand 2 camera is much better then this . also the speaker out put is very low .    
a awesome phone by samsung ,battery is so good,i think its better than lenovo k3 note,and also have a standard look,    
good, very nice product, but camera quality not up to the level , TOUCH FEEL makes happy, camera speed amazing, but SUBWAY SURF GAME IS NOT PLAY SMOOTHLY.    
Everything is near to fine in this phone regarding price display etc. But sound quality of speaker is very poor if you ir traffic or @ market or any even in at less noisy place, it will be not clearly hear able that your phone is ringing 5 out 10 time u will missed the call due to bad quality of speaker    
i bought this phone,i am using redmi 4,moto 3 but when i compare this with j7 i surely recommend you to go for j7 because it has front flash light as it comes with selfie lovers,in part of camera is good than redmi but if we compare with moto its ok and design is mostly same in all samsung but it has some slim model so no doubt we can buy this product.
