by NDTV Correspondent , 16 July 2015
Samsung has launched the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 in India, priced at Rs. 11,999 and Rs. 14,999 respectively. The selfie-focused smartphones will be available to purchase from July 24 exclusively via Flipkart. Pre-booking opens at 4pm on Thursday, and will last till July 23.
The Samsung Galaxy J5 and Samsung Galaxy  J7 were launched first in China last month. Notably, the company has launched slightly different models from those launched in China, with differences including display type, processor, and inbuilt storage. The models launched also do not support TDD-LTE Band 40 (2300MHz) for 4G LTE in India, and only the FDD-LTE Band 3 (1800MHz).
Update: While the specifications initially provided by Samsung India did not  mention support for 2300MHz TDD-LTE Band 40, Samsung has confirmed to  NDTV Gadgets that the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 smartphones do indeed  support this band as well as 1800MHz FDD-LTE Band 3. Airtel uses Band 40  for its 4G services in India right now, and other operators are lining  up to launch 4G services using Band 3.
Samsung says consumers can also opt for Samsung flip covers worth Rs. 999 at Rs. 199 for a limited time period. The South Korean giant has also partnered with Airtel to provide an introductory offer for 4G users which will include double data offer. Customers will also get unlimited music download worth Rs. 594 through Wynk Music app for a period of 6 months.
The  Android 5.1-based smartphones are dual-SIM dual standby handsets that  will be available in Black, White, and Gold colours. Both smartphones feature front-facing LED flash, the first handsets from the company to do so, making them selfie-focus smartphones.
The Samsung  Galaxy J5 features a 5-inch Super Amoled display (instead of the TFT LCD display launched in China) with a HD screen resolution of 720x1280 pixels. The smartphone is backed by 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon  410 SoC coupled with 1.5GB of RAM. The Indian model features 8GB of built-in storage instead of the Chinese model's 16GB, and it is further expandable via microSD card (up to 128GB).
It  packs a 2600mAh battery, which is rated to deliver a standby time of 342  hours. It sports a 13-megapixel rear autofocus camera with f/1.9  aperture and 5-megapixel front camera. Apart from 4G, the handset  supports 3G, Bluetooth v4.1, Wi-Fi, NFC, GPS, Glonass and Micro-USB. The  Galaxy J5 measures 142x73x8.5mm and weighs 149 grams.
The Samsung  Galaxy J7 features similar specifications to the Galaxy J5. The only  differences in the Galaxy J7 are the larger 5.5-inch Super Amoled display (once again, instead of the TFT LCD display launched in China) with  the same resolution, 16GB of inbuilt storage, and a 3000mAh battery rated to deliver 354 hours of  standby time. The smartphone measures 152.2x79.1x7.9mm and weighs 168  grams. Notably, Samsung has launched a variant of the Galaxy J7 in India that sports an 1.5GHz octa-core Exynos 7580 processor instead of the octa-core Snapdragon 615 SoC that was launched with the China model.
The company has also partnered with Gameloft to provide an offer buyers of the Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 handsets, providing free in-game credits of up to Rs. 3,200 for prominent titles like Asphalt 8 and Modern Combat 5, among others.
Asim Warsi, Vice President, Marketing, IT & Mobile at Samsung India, said, "Samsung is committed to lead the 4G revolution by providing new user experiences and latest technolo


Samsung Apple LG Huawei Motorola
In one of the most action packed weeks of late, our Top 10 trending phones chart has been shaken too. No less than 4 new entrants have made it into the top 10 and, believe it or not, one of them storms straight to the top.
The Motorola Moto G (3rd gen) is found in tenth, keeping the Samsung Galaxy A8 out by an inch. Long time podium finisher Galaxy Grand Prime is a notch above in ninth.
The just-released Huawei Nexus 6P is the first of the new additions to the Top 10 chart and is found in eighth spot. The Galaxy Note5 drops four positions and is now in seventh behind the J5. It's the other Nexus, the LG-made 5X, that joins the race in fifth, barely outstripped by the all-new (and rather intriguing) LG V10.
Moving on to the top three, we find that the Galaxy J7 has surrendered its second place from last week and is now in third. The iPhone 6s has climbed up four spots and is now runner-up by number of hits, comfortably ahead of the J7, but equally far from the top.
And this week's number one most researched phone is, out of nowhere, the Samsung Galaxy J2. The affordable 4.7-incher was announced a few weeks ago as part of the Make for India initiative, and we'd guess its recent market launch is the event that's fueled its rise to prominence in this week's Top 10 trending chart.

Can Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo topple Sony Xperia M5 as the true affordable flagship of India?
Can Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo topple Sony Xperia M5 as the true affordable flagship of India?
MID-RANGE SMARTPHONES , SAMSUNG , SONY XPERIA
Sony's affordable flagship, the five-inch Xperia M5, may have met its match with the launch of Samsung Galaxy S5 Neo - another 'affordable flagship' from the Korean company.
The Galaxy S5 Neo, which is reportedly being prepped to be released in India at a price of Rs 25,000-30,000 towards the end of this month, could give would-be Xperia M5 buyers second thoughts.
Even atRs 30,000 - the upper end of the indicated price range - the Galaxy Neo is a value for money offering when compared with Xperia M5, which is also a five-incher and is selling for Rs 34,000 in India right now.
Neo's Advantages
One of the key advantages of the S5 Neo over the Xperia M5 is display quality. The Neo comes with a full-HD AMOLED panel, while the M5 has an LCD panel of the same resolution.
While the Samsung model may look slightly plain compared to the M5, it's a different matter when looking at the two with the naked eye and with the screens switched on.
Other advantages of the Neo is a slightly bigger screen (5.1 inch vs 5.0 inch), a more updated operating system (Android 5.1 vs 5.0) and longer battery life. The phone offers a stated battery life of 15 hours on 3G, while the M5 offers only 12 hours. This is partly due to the bigger, 2.8 Ah battery compared to a 2.6 Ah one on the Sony model.
The Korean company has also made some appearance tweaks to the phone (compared with the original S5) keeping user feedback in mind (see picture from http://winfuture.de at the top.)
M5's advantages
However, if you care more about photographic excellence compared to display colors, the M5 manages to outdo the Samsung model.
Sony's cameras are reputed to be better than those of Samsung, and the M5 comes with a 21 MP shooter that can record 4K video, while the Samsung model will have a 16 MP camera which records up to full-HD video. In other words, there is no comparison in the camera department.
The Xperia has certain other advantages as well. For example, it comes with the tried-and-tested MT6795 Helio X10 processor, while the Samsung model comes with a slightly Exynos 7580, which is also found in the Galaxy J7 (priced at just Rs 14,999).
Though Antutu scores of both platforms are largely similar at around 35,000, the M5 does offer 3 GB of RAM instead of the 2 GB found on the S5 Neo.
In addition, the waterproofing on the Sony model is more robust. The M5 comes with IP68 certification, implying that the phone will work in water of up to to 1.5 meters for 30 minutes. The Neo, on the other hand, has IP67 certification, implying water resistance in up to 1 meter of water for 30 minutes.
Onboard storage memory in both phones is 16 GB, and both come with support for MicroSD cards, which sets them apart from certain Chinese models such as Meizu MX5 and OnePlus Two.
Flipkart Exclusive?
However, the Galaxy S5 Neo may yet have one more trump card up its sleeve - pricing. Going by market buzz, the Samsung could price the phone in the Rs 25,000 range if it makes it an online exclusive. At that price, the phone would also take on the OnePlus Two, which is priced at Rs 24,999 for a 32 GB model with no expandable memory.
The original Galaxy S5 was released February 2014 and came with no 3G - a factor which hampered its sales in India. The phone is available in today's market at Rs 22,000.

Samsung Galaxy J7 Listed by Online Retailer Ahead of Launch
by NDTV Correspondent , 8 June 2015
Samsung seems to be gearing up to introduce a new Galaxy Android  smartphone, the Galaxy J7, which has gone up for pre-orders via an  online retailer. So far, there has been no announcement on the launch of  the Samsung Galaxy J7.
According to the Kazakhstan-based online retailer , the Galaxy J7 is available to pre-order at KZT 49,990  (approximately Rs. 17,250). The online retailer however suggests that  the smartphone's sale is expected to start in August only.
The  online retailer lists some of the specifications of the Samsung Galaxy  J7 including a 5.5-inch HD (720X1280 pixels) TFT LCD display; a  13-megapixel rear camera; a 5-megapixel front camera; an octa-core  Marvell PXA1936 processor clocked at 1.2GHz (the retailer also lists a  clock speed of 1.4GHz in some places); 1.5GB of RAM, and 16GB of inbuilt  storage. The handset supports expandable storage via microSD card (up  to 128GB). The listing also suggests that the Galaxy J7 runs Android  5.0.2 Lollipop.
Of course since this is a third-party store, one  cannot be certain if this is the launch price or exact specifications,  whenever the Samsung Galaxy J7 is officially unveiled.
Earlier  this month, Samsung's Galaxy S6 Active was briefly listed  on the company site with specifications. As per the Samsung US'  support page, the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active features the same set of  specifications as its original flagship variant, the Samsung Galaxy S6 . The  handset features 5.1-inch Quad HD (1440x2560 pixels) Super Amoled  display and is powered by company's own octa-core Exynos 7420 SoC.
The  Samsung Galaxy S6 Active comes with 32GB of inbuilt storage, besides a  16-megapixel rear camera and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The  smartphone is seen backed by a 2550mAh non-removable battery. Also, the  device measures and weighs the same as the Galaxy S6 - 143.5x70.6x6.85mm  and 138 grams. Notably, the company is yet to reveal the Galaxy S6  Active.

Samsung Galaxy J7 4G to take on Lenovo A7000 in India, price Rs 14,000
Samsung Galaxy J7 4G to take on Lenovo A7000 in India, price Rs 14,000
ENTRY-LEVEL SMARTPHONES , HUAWEI , LENOVO , MID-RANGE SMARTPHONES , NEW PHONES , SAMSUNG , XIAOMI
So you thought Lenovo, Xiaomi and Huawei are going to run-away with the low-priced LTE market in India and Samsung would just stand aside and watch?
It seems that may be a wrong assessment as the Samsung Galaxy J7, arguably the most value-for-money offering from the Korean giant in recent years, will set the record straight.
In terms of specifications, the Galaxy J7 is almost exactly the same as the Lenovo A7000 and Huawei Honor 4X. The only major deviation is that while the Lenovo and Huawei models have 2 GB of RAM, the Galaxy J7 has only 1.5 GB of RAM. However, that is unlikely to make a huge difference in many consumers' eyes.
UPDATE: Prices of Galaxy J5 will be around Rs 11,500 and J7 around Rs 14,500.
The Samsung J7 represents a huge leap forward in the company's attempt to target price-sensitive buyers. Just one year ago, such a phone from Samsung would have cost Rs 20,000.
The J7, like the Lenovo A7000 and Honor 4x, is also a 5.5-inch model. Like the others, it too comes with a 720p HD display. Unlike the E7, priced at Rs 19,000, the J7 does not come with an AMOLED display but a normal LCD screen, and this is seen bringing down the price of the J7 by about Rs 4,000 compared to the E7.
According to our source, Samsung could further optimize its pricing to the Rs 12,500-13,000 range if it chooses to tie-up with Amazon as it had for the launch of its J1 back in February.
At the time, Amazon had launched the phone at just Rs 7,199. But when the J1 became available with other retailers, it was priced at Rs 7,600. The cost of distribution using online retail is much lower than that of traditional retail, and therefore, companies are able to price their handsets lower on e-commerce portals.
However, there is no clarity yet on whether Samsung would go for a tie-up with Amazon for the J7 as well. "If it does, it can bring down the retail price by 1,000-1,500 rupees," said an industry source. Even without such a tie-up, Samsung is likely to price the phone aggressively in the Rs 14,000-15,000 range to see off competition from the A7000, Honor 4x etc.
One of the differentiators of the J7 will be its processor. For the model, Samsung has chosen to tap chipmaker Marvel, popular in China, but a newcomer to the Indian market.
The Galaxy J7 will be powered by the Marvel PXA1936 octa-core processor with 64-bit support and built-in LTE. In terms of power, the PXA1936 is comparable to the MediaTek MT6752 processor that lies inside the Lenovo A7000.
The phone will be launched in India before the end of April. No word, yet, on when the Galaxy J5 will be launched. Besides, there is much confusion about the configuration of the J5.
The higher-end Galaxy E5 is priced at Rs 16,000, and the J5 will have to be priced in the Rs 12,000 range to make it attractive viz a viz the E5. The key difference between the J series phones and the E series phones is the display technology.
The E series come with AMOLED displays, while the J series come with normal LCD displays. AMOLED displays offer better color and contrast as each 'dot' emits its own light, unlike LCD panels, where the light is emitted by a panel of LEDs behind the screen.
The point of confusion about the J5 is the underlying processor. While many expect it to be Snapdragon 410, chances are that the model would also come with Marvel PXA1936.
Samsung's new line-up consists of the following sub-brands:
Top-end 'S' Series, which will be priced around Rs 50,000 for regular versions and Rs 40,000 for the compact versions.
The high-end 'A' Series, of which the A3, A5 and A7 have already been released, and the A9 is expected soon. This will be aimed at the value-conscious buyer who does not want to compromise on specifications. As a result, all top-end specifications, such as LTE, quad-HD displays etc, will be found in this category. However, in terms of looks and processor-capability, the Galaxy A series would trail the S series. Both the A5 and the A7 come with LTE. The A9 is expected to come with a quad-HD display.
The A5 was priced around Rs 25,000, while the A7 is priced at around Rs 30,500 at launch. The A9 is expected to be priced around the Rs 36,000 mark.
The Galaxy E Series is meant for the 'mid range' market, where people are willing to compromise on specifications to save money. The E7, which is a 5.5-inch model, is priced at Rs 19,500, while the E5, a 5-inch model, is priced at Rs 16,000. Neither have LTE, and come with 720p displays super AMOLED displays.
The entry level Android phones would be launched under the 'Galaxy J Series' brand. Being entry level, the display will not be super Amoled, but PLS LCD. Only the J1 has been launched yet, and is priced at Rs 7,200, with both J5 and J7 in the pipeline.

Wrapping up
The underdog might just win your heart.
Asus and Samsung are two very reputed brands in the smartphone industry and why wouldn't they be. Both the companies have brought many firsts in the smartphone world. For instance while Samsung, the No 1 smartphone brand in the world, pioneered phablets with Galaxy Note and brought first curved display smartphone. While Asus was the first device maker to bring a smartphone with 4 GB RAM, the Zenfone 2.
Here we have thus brought two noted mid-range smartphones of both Samsung and Asus. From Samsung's stable there is Galaxy J7 while on the other hand there is the Zenfone 2 ZE551ML. Both these phones are priced at Rs 14,999. Let us see which one deserves your money.
Design
The Samsung Galaxy J7 has slim bezels and a metal rim and comes with the traditional Samsung design. The phone measures 152.2 x 79.1 x 7.9 mm and weighs 169 grams.
The Asus ZenFone 2 is a phone dominated by brushed metal. The phone is a bold looking device, and has average sized bezels. While it measures 152.5 x 77.2 x 10.9 to 3.2 mm, it weighs 170 grams. The phone doesn't have the smallest footprint, but the curved back makes it very easy to handle.
Display
The Asus ZenFone 2 is armed with a 5.5 inch TFT display with 1920 x 1080 pixels resolution (full HD), thus offering pixel density of 403 ppi.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 has a bigger 5.7 inch HD TFT display but with lesser resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels, resulting in a pixel density of 267.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 has a slightly bigger screen, but the Asus Zenfone 2 has a far better resolution, and thus is the winner.
Processor & Memory
The Samsung Galaxy J7 is armed with a Snapdragon 615 1.4 GHz octa-core processor, and runs with 1.5 GB of RAM. The internal storage stands at 16 GB to which you can add another 128 GB via a microSD card.
The Asus ZenFone 2 on the other hand has a 64-bit processor, the Intel Atom Z3560, which is a quad-core processor clocked at 1.8 GHz and runs with 2 GB of RAM and has 16 GB of internal storage to which you can add another 64 GB via a microSD card.
The Asus Zenfone 2 is ahead when it comes to the processing ability but the Samsung Galaxy J7 is better at storing data.
Software
The Asus ZenFone 2 runs on Android Lollipop, with Asus's Zen UI on top of it. The Zen UI is a very responsive and easy to use OS with lot of added features.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 too runs on Android Lollipop and has the well-known Samsung Touch Wiz OS.
Battery
The Samsung Galaxy J7 runs a 3000 mAh battery which can provide 15 hours of talk time or 354 hours of standby.
The Asus Zenfone 2 too has a 3000 mAh battery, but Asus hasn't specified how long the battery will last.
Camera
The Asus ZenFone 2 is armed with a 13 megapixel shooter with an aperture of F/2.0 and 5-element lens. It has auto-focus, dual-colour real tone flash, panorama, PixelMaster: low light mode, HDR, enhanced beautification mode, manual mode, and zero shutter lag features and can record videos at 1080p at 30 fps. In the front of the Asus ZenFone 2 there is a 5 megapixel selfie taker with an aperture of F/2.0 and 85 degree wide angle lens (with panorama selfie).
The Samsung Galaxy J7 has a 13 megapixel primary camera with auto-focus, geo-tagging, touch focus, face detection, panorama, flash, and video recording at 1080p at 30 fps. For selfies, it offers a 5 megapixel front camera.
The Asus Zenfone 2 might have more features, but since the specs are so closely matched, we will wait to call a winner till a real world test.
Connectivity
The Asus ZenFone 2 is a dual-SIM 4G phone with WiFi, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS with GLONASS, and NFC.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 also has dual-SIM, 4G, GPS (A-GPS and GLONASS), Bluetooth 4.1.1, WiFi, and NFC.
Wrapping up
We feel that the Asus is the better package overall, as it has better looks, a higher resolution display, and higher processing ability. The Samsung does have the edge when it comes to the screen size and storage, while camera, battery, and connectivity remain equal.

Moto G 3rd gen vs Samsung Galaxy J7 price and specs
August 23, 2015
By Debbie Turner Leave a Comment
There were plenty of people waiting for the new Moto G 2015 to release and Motorola duly obliged with the Moto G 3rd gen.  This is an affordable smartphone and one of its competitors is likely to be a recent Samsung arrival, the Galaxy J7.  Today we're comparing the Moto G 3rd gen vs Samsung Galaxy J7 in a price and specs shootout.
The 3rd gen Moto G is widely available in various regions worldwide and is available in single SIM or dual SIM options.  The Galaxy J7 released first in China and more recently went on sale in India, and could be making its way to further markets.  We'll consider the key specs and more of each, including pricing, to show what they have to offer.
Processors
The Moto G 3rd gen has a 1.4GHz Snapdragon 410 quad-core processor and Adreno 306 graphics.  The Samsung Galaxy J7 is powered by a Snapdragon 615 octa-core processor (4 cores at 1.4GHz and 4 at 1GHz) with Adreno 405 GPU.  Alternatively for some markets the Galaxy J7 has a 1.5GHz Exynos 7580 octa-core processor and Mali-T720MP2 graphics.
Display
The Motorola phone has a 5-inch IPS LCD display with HD resolution of 1280 x 720 resulting in 294 ppi.  The Galaxy J7 has a 5.5-inch Super AMOLED display also with HD resolution, this time resulting in 267 ppi.
RAM and Storage
The Moto G 3rd gen comes in two variants.  One has 1GB of RAM and 8GB of internal storage and the other has 2GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage.  Both are expandable to 32GB via microSD.  The Samsung phone has 1.5GB of RAM and 16GB of internal storage, expandable with microSD to 128GB.
Camera set-up
There's not much between them here as both handsets have a 13-megapixel rear camera with 1080p video capture, as well as a 5-megapixel front-facing camera.  However, the new Moto G has dual-LED flash while the Samsung phone has a single flash, but the Galaxy J7 also has flash for the front-facing camera which the Moto G lacks.
Battery
The Moto G 3rd gen has a non-removable 2470 mAh battery.  The Galaxy J7 has a removable 3000 mAh battery.
Connectivity
The Moto G 3rd gen supports 4G LTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n with WiFi hotspot, Bluetooth 4.0, GPS, microUSB 2.0 and USB Host.  The Galaxy J7 has 4G LTE, WiFi 802.11 b/g/n with WiFi hotspot, WiFi Direct, Bluetooth 4.1, GPS, and microUSB 2.0.
Operating System
The latest Moto G runs virtually stock Android 5.1.1 Lollipop.  The Galaxy J7 runs Android 5.1.
Dimensions and Weight
The Motorola phone is thicker but lighter.  It measures 142.1mm x 72.4mm x 11.6mm and weighs 155g.  The Galaxy handset measures 152.2mm x 78.7mm x 7.5mm and weighs 171g.
Price
Pricing will vary according to market and retailers but generally the Samsung phone is the more expensive of the two.  For example in India the Moto G 3rd is priced at Rs. 11,999 for the lesser storage model or Rs. 12,999 for the 2GB RAM variant.  In the US the Moto G 3rd gen 1GB is priced at $179 or the 2GB model is $219.99.  Meanwhile the Samsung Galaxy J7 is priced at Rs. 14,999 in India.  It hasn't launched in the US (yet?) but the Chinese price equivalent equates to approximately $289 while the equivalent of the India price is around $226.
These companies are both big brand names, and both have plenty of loyal fans that will choose between them purely on that basis.  Potential buyers should also consider their preference of design and build, but we have to say that the higher price of the Samsung phone is reflected in the specs.  For example the Galaxy J7 has an octa-core processor, larger display, a higher level of expandable storage, and higher capacity battery that's also removable.  It's also a much slimmer handset.
The Moto G 3rd gen still has plenty to offer for its cheaper price tag though, including a later version of Android.  Although it's notably bulkier its overall size is more compact, and some buyers may prefer this.  Another benefit of the Moto G 3rd gen is water-resistance.  Of course it also has the advantage of a lower price, although the difference in pricing will vary by market.
When you have considered the above we'd be interested to hear which of these phones gets your vote.  Are you more likely to purchase the Moto G 3rd gen or the Samsung Galaxy J7?

South Korean tech giant Samsung Electronics just released two new smartphone devices, the Samsung Galaxy J5 and the Samsung Galaxy J7, to the Chinese market.
GSM Arena
Samsung Gala J1
The two new smartphones come with front-facing LED flashes accompanied by 5 mega pixel cameras. This marks the first time for Samsung to develop handsets with LED flashes on the front, according to reports.
As part of the J series, the new Samsung Galaxy J5 and Samsung Galaxy J7 are designed for selfie enthusiasts. Reports say the move comes after Samsung's recent release of another two new devices, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S and the Samsung Galaxy Tab E, in India.
Here's the difference between the new mid-range Samsung Galaxy J7 handset and Samsung's recently released Samsung Galaxy S6, in terms of the specs and features.
The new Samsung Galaxy J7 handset sports a 5.5 inch TFT display screen, which is larger than the Samsung Galaxy S6's 5.1 inch Super AMOLED display screen. The J7's display screen has a 720 x 1280 resolution and the S6's display comes with a 1440 x 2560 resolution and is protected by Corning Gorilla Glass 3.
Both phones run on the latest Android Lollipop operating system, but while the new Galaxy J7 has only 1.5 GB worth of RAM with 16 GB internal memory storage, the Galaxy S6 has 3 GB RAM and up to 128 GB internal memory.
The new Samsung Galaxy J7 offers a larger 3000 mAh battery compared to the S6's non-removable 2550 mAh battery. The new handset comes with only 13 mega pixel rear camera and the Galaxy S6 comes with a sharper 16 mega pixel rear camera. Both phones have 5 mega pixel front-facing cameras, and the only difference is obviously the LED flash that's found on the J7.
Another new handset that's expected to be released by the South Korean tech giant is the Galaxy A8, which is expected to have a 5.9 mm thin body, according to new images. For the new Samsung Galaxy J7, it's unclear whether it will be released to other regions outside of China.

Samsung will launch its much awaited Galaxy J5 in India this month, followed closely by the J7, according to distributor sources.
The 5-inch Galaxy J5 will be priced around Rs 12,000, while the larger J7 will be priced closer to Rs 15,000.
As reported earlier, the J Series is the lowest priced in the new Alphabet sub-branding introduced by the Korean company recently.
The J5 (price Rs 12,000) will be placed below the E5 (price Rs 15,000), which itself is priced below the A5 (Rs 21,000).
At Rs 12,000, the Galaxy J5 will be Rs 3,000 cheaper than the E5.
However, unlike the E5, which comes with an AMOLED 720p display, the J5 will come with a normal 720p display.
According to media reports, the J5 will also be built around the Snapdragon 410 chipset, which has built in LTE support. In contrast, E5 does not have LTE despite its higher price.
The J5 will compete with Lenovo A6000 Plus, Redmi 2 and S60 .
The Galaxy J7, meanwhile, will come with Marvel PXA1936 octa-core processor, which will help the Korean company keep the price of the J7 in the Rs 15,000 range.
At 5.5 inches, the J7 is the cheaper version of the E7.
The E7, priced at around Rs 19,500, comes with an AMOLED 720p display and offers built-in LTE support. Just like in the case of J5, the J7 will come with no AMOLED display.
Still, at Rs 15,000 the Galaxy J7 will be a strong contender for those looking for an entry-level large-display LTE phone. However, the J7 will face competition from the
Meizu M1 Note , which offers 2 GB of RAM and an AMOLED display of the same resolution at Rs around 16,000. The Meizu M1 Note is also expected to be officially released in India around the same time.
At present, Samsung has launched only the Galaxy J1, with a price of Rs 7,200 in India.

Samsung gets ready to launch Galaxy J5, J7 and J2 to take on Lenovo, Yuphoria
Samsung gets ready to launch Galaxy J5, J7 and J2 to take on Lenovo, Yuphoria
ENTRY , LENOVO , MICROMAX YU , SAMSUNG
Galaxy J5
After introducing its first J series model, J1, three months ago, Samsung is about to introduce its own versions of low-cost 4G handsets - the Galaxy J5, J7 and possibly the J2, in India.
These are the phones that Samsung hopes will help it beat back competition from the likes of Lenovo A6000 Plus, Lenovo A7000, Coolpad Dazen 1 and Yu Yuphoria.
However, going by the launch, review and reception of the J1, Samsung is likely to find the going extremely hard in India.
But first, a brief introduction to the upcoming 4G line-up from the Korean giant.
At the entry level, we have the Samsung Galaxy J2. Unfortunately, other than the fact that this 4.7-inch phone will be priced in the Rs 9,000 range, we know almost nothing about it.
Will it have 4G? Possibly, given that it would be very, very tough for the company to sell the J2 without LTE at Rs 9,000 given where the market is today in India.
What we do know a fair deal about are the other two J series phones - the Galaxy J5 and the Galaxy J7.
The J5, like the E5 and the A5, will be a 5-inch phone. However, unlike the E5, the J5 will come with a non-AMOLED 720p (not full-HD) display.
It will be built on the Snapdragon 410 chipset, and will therefore have built in 4G LTE.
In terms of most other specifications, the Galaxy J5 resembles the Lenovo phone that it will be inevitably compared against - the A7000: 1.5 GB of RAM (vs 2 GB on the A6000 Plus and A7000), 5 MP camera on the front (same as A7000, but better than A6000 Plus' 2 MP shooter), and the same chipset as the A6000 Plus.
However, at market operating price of Rs 12,000/13,000, the Galaxy J5 will not simply be a more costly version of the A7000. There are key differences that the Samsung model enjoys.
The most important among those is the back camera. The J5 will come with a 13 MP camera, while both Lenovo models have 8 MP ones. The other key difference is the higher brand value that Samsung enjoys and the strong service support that India's biggest electronics brand provides.
There might be other advantages too for the J5 over the Lenovo models, but we'll get to know that only when the phone actually launches early in July. (It was earlier expected to launch in early June.)
The Galaxy J7 is essentially a slightly more powerful and bigger version of the J5. Display size is 21% higher at 5.5 inches diagonal, while the processor has been bumped up to Snapdragon 615, though there are also reports that it will be the largely-similar Marvel PXA1936 octa-core as well.
The J7 will be priced at around Rs 15,000/16,000 initially, though MRP would be higher.
WILL J SERIES WORK?
One of the lessons that Samsung doesn't seem to have learnt enough of is that Indians are unlikely to pay 60% simply to have their phone from the biggest smartphone brand.
A case in point is the J1. At about 1.5 stars out of 5, the J1 has one of the worst ratings of all phones in the price-band, if not the worst.
And the reason is not far to seek either: It's the price.
For Rs 7,200, the phone offers specifications that others like Huawei offer at a price of Rs 4,500. However, the customer reviews of J1 make for entertaining reading.
"Fire your r&d team, with ideas like this you cannot beat xiaomi/lenovo/micromax," suggests Saurabh Saxena helpfully under the title 'nobody cares'.
User Santosh betrays a little more emotion. "Worst phone ever !!!! 512 mb ram???? are you kidding me?? this is 2015, with phones like Redmi 1s have delivered 1 gb for just 6999 way back in 2014!!!!!! Grow up Samsung!!!!!"
Then there's Mac, who knows exactly who the target audience for J1 would be: "Buy this only if you have some excess money in your wallet and have absolutely no clue what to do with it."
In fact, these are just a sample, and if you have 'excess time' on your hands, you can read the full list of outpourings here .
Now, back to the new J series. Would J5 make sense for Rs 12,000? Frankly, it's cheap by Samsung standards. But as the reviewers point out, it's not the same market anymore.
But the good thing is that models become cheaper soon after launch and we can expect some relief on the price front in coming months.
What should really worry Samsung is the fact that is it catching up with the likes of Lenovo, Xiaomi and Huawei months after they launched entry-level, 720p, 4G smartphones.

With the advent of Chinese OEMS into the Indian market the Korean giant had been struggling in the midrange and the low range sections. Their Galaxy Grand and Core devices priced round Rs 10,000 and above were no match for the devices launched by companies like Xiaomi, Oppo. While the Grand Grand 2 with Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 still retails at Rs 14,999 on e-commerce sites, the flagship Xiaomi Mi4 can be bought at Rs 14,999. Thankfully Samsung took notice of this, and here they are with the Samsung J7. But can the device match the likes of the Mi4i priced lower at Rs 12,999? Let's find out.
Build and Design:
Samsung was never a king of this category! I always felt that their sub 15K device were never up to the mark in terms of design. The worst part is we were seing the same design language in all their devices - to boring to be honest. But I was glad that Samsung finally did a change with their flagship of 2015, Galaxy S6.
Nevertheless the Samsung J7 is plain old ordinary designed phone from the company we had been seing all while. The body is made out of plastic and to be honest the quality of materials used is not great! A metal like rim running all way round the side profile of the device.
On the other hand the Mi4i comes with an above average build quality. It feels a lot more firm and well-built mainly due the polycarbonate body. I can even vouch for the fact that, this device is one of the best build device from Xiaomi- and that too with an original design. It's even marginally slimmer than the Samsung J7 by 0.1 mm.
Display:
There's some marked difference between the two devices here. The Samsung J7 is more of phablet with a 5.5inch HD Super AMOLED display whereas the Mi4i features a 5 inch IPS panel sourced from Sharp/AUO. So for those who wants a big screen device, the J7 would be an obvious choice. You may give a think regarding the Yureka Plus and the K3 Note too .
But the worst part is yet to come. Despite featuring a 5.5 inch display the J7's display is only HD i.e. 1280x720! That's reflects at a pretty low ppi(pixel per inch) looking at today's standards. The Xiaomi Mi4i on the other hand features a Full HD IPS OGS display (1920x1080) with top notch color reproduction and viewing angles. The display possess 90% NTSC color gamut, against the 85% found in most top of the end device of today.
To be perfectly honest this display (comparable to the likes of Mi Note) is better than the one found in the flagship Mi4. Plus it comes with a nifty trick down its sleeve, the 'Sunlight Display' which changes the contrast of the display according to the lighting condition of surrounding. And the best part is that it really does work quite well in a harsh sunny day!
Under the hood:
Here both the devices match each other head on head. While the Xiaomi Mi4i comes with a 2nd gen Snapdragon 615 octacore SoC (4 Cortex A53 cores at 1.7GHz and the other 4 at 1.1GHz each), the Indian version of the J7 comes with the company's own octacore Exynos 7580. The international variants of J7 would come with a Snapdragon 615 though.
The SD615 had been in the news for all wrong reasons of late and the Mi4i had a lot to contribute to the fact. The devices heated up like anything but the company had solved the issues marginally since the last few updates. But I wouldn't recommend you to go with the Mi4i if you are looking for high performance. Go with the Samsung J7 as it will be more reliable. Despite curbing the heating issues the SD615 chipset falls prey to excessive throttling, thereby lowering the performance after a half an hour of heavy usage.

But if multitasking is your priority then I would recommend you against the J7. It features a meagre 1.5GB RAM in contrast to the 2GB present in the Mi4i. The reason I mention meagre here because the Samsung TouchWiz is a RAM hungry UI by itself! Don't expect anything more than 700GB of free RAM on the J7. Mi4 usually delivers something round 900-1GB.
Camera:
Let's make this decision easy for you. Are you a 'Selfie' focused person? If so close your eyes and grab the Samsung J7! It features a 5MP front facing camera with a 120 degree wide angle lens. But do remember it has a LED flash - this is where it beats the Mi4i 5MP front snapper hands down.
Coming to the back camera, the Mi4i holds its own here. It features a 13MP f2.0 unit with a 5 element lens. The sensor used here is none other than IMX214 (found in the popular flagships like the Mi4, One Plus One, Oppo Find 7). On the other hand J7 uses a Samsung made sensor. Both devices can shoot 1080p videos at 30fps.
OS:
I am personally not fond of the TouchWiz UI and I feel many of you out there would share my views. It hogs up the RAM without providing much a functionality. Plus one gets a number of added bloatware.
The MIUI 6 on the Mi4 though is very much customisable and utilitarian. It comes with a number of useful features that most ROMs generally don't offer as of now.
Both the devices runs on Android Lollipop 5.0.1 out of the box. Futures updates are also a possibility.
Battery:
The batteries on both the devices are a close match. While the Mi4i features a 3120mah battery, the J7 carries a 3000mah unit. Personally I feel that both the device would deliver a nearly same battery life and the extra 120mah won't make a difference. You may ask me why though! It's because that SD615 still heats up (better than before though) like anything and results in hogging down the battery life. The Exynos on the other hand has a cooler hierarchy.
Verdict:
In one line - 'Samsung J7 is a spirted attempt to match up with its Chinese counterparts, but it is still not up to the mark'. The Samsung J7 do bring something new to the table though- especially the front LED flash and the Exynos 7580.

Moto X Play, priced at Rs 18,499 for the 16GB model and Rs 19,999 for the 32GB variant, did not lag or stutter while navigating the phone's UI and launching and switching between apps during the time we spent with it.

<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: medium;">Moto X P... Read More
NEW DELHI: Motorola introduced two new variants of its Moto X flagship this year. The company has introduced the mid-range variant, Moto X Play, in India making inroads into a new category. We spent some time with the Moto X Play and here are our first impressions...
At first glance, the Moto X Play reminds us of the latest Moto G, Motorola's popular budget smartphone. It has the same dual-grille design at the front with a glossy panel; however, the front and bottom bezel is relatively smaller. While the Moto X Play packs in a 5.5-inch full-HD panel, Motorola has tried to keep the screen to body ratio optimum to make it more compact. We still feel the phone isn't fit for one-hand use if you have small hands. The phone has a metal frame that extends to the back. The frame has a soft touch finish and feels nice to touch.
Moto X Play full specs
Moto X Play's 5.5-inch full-HD (1020x1920p) IPS display that offers wide viewing angles, good brightness levels and sharp text and images. However, colours are not as vivid as they're on AMOLED displays. We were not able to use the phone under direct sunlight.
The metallic volume rocker and power keys are at the right edge of the phone with the latter sporting a ribbed design. The keys are a bit narrow but offer decent tactile feedback. The 3.5mm headset jack sits at the top along with a sim card/microSD card tray while the microUSB port is at the bottom edge.
Just like the new Moto G, the Moto X Play has a curved back with the thickness ranging from 8.9mm to 10.9mm. The Moto X Play comes with changeable back covers and the default one sports a rubberized finish and a texture to enhance the grip. It's easily removable but you'll only see a sealed battery compartment after taking it off. The back also features a metallic strip that houses the 21MP camera, a dual-LED flash and the indented Motorola logo. We've seen the strip on the third-gen Moto G and it gives the phone's back a slightly fancy look.
According to Motorola, the Moto X Play sports a nano-coating that creates a water repellent barrier to help protect against moderate exposure to water, such as accidental spills, splashes, or light rain. However, it is not waterproof and not designed to be submersed in water, or exposed to pressurized water unlike the new Moto G.
The phone has a 21MP rear camera with f/2.0 aperture and support for full-HD video recording. The phone has a 5MP front-facing camera. In our brief use, we found that the phone's camera app was snappy while clicking photos. We'll need to spend more time with the phone to give our verdict on the camera.
In terms of software, the experience is very close to stock Android with the Moto X Play running Android 5.1 Lollipop. Motorola also includes some of its own system apps. The Gallery, Messagging and Camera apps have been customized by the company. There are some additional Motorola features including Moto Display, Assist, Help and support for gestures to activate camera and torch functions.
The Moto X Play is powered by the 1.7GHz octa-core 64-bit Snapdragon 615 processor with 2GB RAM. The smartphone offers dual-sim support and support for 4G LTE (all Indian bands), 3G, NFC and Bluetooth among others. In our brief time with the phone we did not experience any lag or stutter while navigating the phone's UI and launching and switching between apps.
It comes in 16GB and 32GB storage variants with support for microSD cards. The 16GB version is priced at Rs 18,499 while the 32GB version costs Rs 19,999.

Samsung Introduces Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 in India, Know the Specs
Jul 29, 2015
By Aditya Leave a Comment
Samsung has been a name which has been one of the biggest gainers of the Android wave.
Ever since the android phones started booming in late 2008, Samsung has capitalized on every opportunity, every chance that they have had of gaining market credibility.
The company has been quite successful as they have been releasing phones very frequently, and at various price points, making it possible for people of all income brackets to easily buy a phone of their choice.
It is because of this reason that Samsung has become the leading names when it comes to sales of android based smartphones in most major countries, including India where they hold a 24% market share.
The company has been doing well in the Asian markets at large, and had last month released the Samsung Galaxy J5 and J7 in the markets of China.
The phones have now been introduced into the Indian markets and have entered at the sub-15000 zone, which has been the sweet spot for most of the mobile phone manufacturers in India.
The phones have been entered at a price of Rs. 11,999 for the J5 and 14,999 for the J7.
According to reports from NDTV, the two new phones are also positioned by Samsung as affordable devices for gamers as they can potentially deliver smooth online gaming experiences using 4G LTE connectivity.
As of this report both the phones are flipkart exclusives.
The two new Samsung smartphones both run Android 5.1.1 but have a few differences.
The Samsung Galaxy J5 features a 5-inch Super Amoled HD display; a 1.2GHz quad-core Snapdragon 410 SoC; 1.5GB of RAM; 8GB of built-in storage; a 13-megapixel rear autofocus camera; a 5-megapixel front camera, and a 2,600mAh battery.
As for the Samsung Galaxy J7, it features a 5.5-inch screen; 16GB of inbuilt storage, a 1.5GHz octa-core Exynos 7580 SoC, and a 3,000mAh battery. Both handsets' inbuilt storage can be expanded via microSD card (up to 128GB).
Interestingly enough, the China versions of the J5 and J7 are slightly different as they feature TFT screens instead of super amoled screens, while the J5 comes with 16GB of storage instead of 8GB, and the J7 has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 615 instead of the Exynos 7580.
Samsung has again disappointed with the look and feel of the phone as it again appears that you can pretty much put a different chipset in the same body and sell it.
The phones look like every other Samsung phone, but at the price point they are quite good.
The phones will both be running Android 5.1.1. The J5 has a 2600mAh battery while the J7 comes with a 3,000mAh.

Samsung Galaxy J7 reportedly spotted on user agent profile
By Mahit Huilgol on Apr 2, 2015 at 10:39 AM

A user agent profile with the model number SM-J700F has been spotted online and it might eventually end up being another product in the Samsungs Galaxy J series. If the model number is anything to go by, the smartphone could be the Galaxy J7,  PhoneArena reports .The smartphone seems to be a mid-segment smartphone sporting a 5.5-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) display, and it could be powered by a 1.5GHz Cortex A53 chipset. There is still no clarity on the other hardware specifications as Samsung user profile only reveals limited data.
It's intriguing that the SM-J700 has already been spotted on  Zauba , the Indian import/export repository. It clearly indicates that two phones have been imported to India for testing and developmental purposes.
As mentioned above, Samsung's J series only has the  Galaxy J1  at the moment. The smartphone features a 4.3-inch WVGA (800×480 pixels) display, 1.2GHz Cortex-A7 dual-core processor, 512MB of RAM, and 4GB internal storage that can be further expanded up to 64GB using a microSD card.
The smartphone also features a 5-megapixel rear camera, 2-megapixel front-facing camera, 1,850mAh battery, and connectivity options like dual-SIM card slots, 3G support, Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. On the software front, it runs on Android 4.4 KitKat. It is available on Amazon India with a price tag of Rs 7,190.

Samsung Galaxy J7 smartphone leaked, runs on Android 5.0.2
Details about the upcoming Samsung Galaxy J7 have leaked and show that it features a 1.5GHz ARM-53 CPU and a 720p display.
Tweet
 
Information regarding an upcoming budget smartphone from Samsung, the Galaxy J7, has been leaked. The information about the Samsung Galaxy J7 was leaked via a Samsung user agent profile. This upcoming phone may be a viable competitor to other budget phones as a shipping record reveals that the phone is priced at Rs. 15,908.
The leaked data suggests that the smartphone is powered by an ARM-53 CPU which has a maximum clock speed of 1.5GHz. These specifications do match a particular SoC, which we believe is the new 64-bit Mediatek 6732. This SoC from MediaTek comprises of a quad-core CPU configuration based on ARM-53 architecture with its CPUs at clocked 1.5GHz.
The display will have a resolution of 1280 x 720p but the display size has not been revealed. Other details like RAM, storage and camera sensors are still a mystery. The device runs on Android 5.0.2 . The smartphone is under testing which was confirmed by the shipping details, which reveal that two units are already in India for testing purposes.
Samsung also revealed the Samsung Galaxy J1 earlier this year which was an entry level smartphone.


Samsung Preinstalled Some Games On The Galaxy J5 And J7
August 10, 2015 - Written By Diego Macias
Samsung announced the Galaxy J5 and the Galaxy J7 about two months ago, they have been available in China, India and some European countries. Even as the name suggested that these phones belonged to the low-end, their specs actually belong to mid-range devices built with plastic. The Galaxy J5 features a 5-inch HD display, a quad-core Snapdragon 410 processor with 1.5 GB. The Galaxy J7 has a larger 5.5-inch display but it keeps the resolution the same, it uses an octa core Snapdragon 615 and the amount of RAM is the same as in the smaller phone. Both include a main camera of 13 megapixels and a front-facing one of 5 megapixels. What's interesting is that they include an LED flash on the front, making them the first Samsung devices to include such a feature. This, of course, is to make selfies taken under low-light look better, which implies that the phones are targeted to a teenage audience.
The company redesigned some aspects of its software to make it lighter so it would have less impact on the resources of the phones. This included the removal of some apps that were installed by default, although they included some apps from Microsoft, supposedly to improve the productivity. Now, it has been reported that Samsung decided to include some games from Gameloft in the two aforementioned phones. These games are installed as system apps, so they can't be uninstalled, they can only be disabled if the user doesn't want to see their icons, but they would still take up some space.
This may be to entice the potential buyers of the phones, as Samsung is also offering some in-app credits valued at Rs. 3,200 (about $50). Some of the titles include Asphalt 8: Airborne, Modern Combat 5: Blackout, GT Racing 2: The Real Car Experience and Six Guns: Gang Showdown, the credits are distributed among all of the titles. Of course, there could be users that would not like to have some of these titles preinstalled in their devices, especially when the internal storage starts at 8 GB on the J5 and some titles are quite heavy. It's clear that partnerships like these prevents bloatware to be installed in the devices, not to mention the apps installed by carriers .

Samsung Galaxy J5 And Galaxy J7 Are The Next Devices To Join The Galaxy J Series
April 8, 2015 - Written By Cory McNutt
In an effort to ' reorganize ' their smartphone offerings, Samsung now has the Galaxy S series as its main flagship device and the Galaxy Note devices as their phablet flagship.  After that, they are offering a new single-letter naming convention - the higher mid-range devices are the Galaxy A3, A5 and A7 with Super AMOLED displays, a metal frame and higher resolution front-facing cameras (FFC).  Next in line, they have their mid-range smartphone, the Galaxy 'E' series range of less expensive models.  The Galaxy 'J' series will cover the lower-midrange area with 64-bit processors and 4G LTE.  If all of this sounds confusing, it was far worse before this reorganization.
The Samsung Galaxy J1 (shown above) made its debut the first part of January in India.  It has slowly spread out to the Netherlands and Germany, and more recently to the Philippines.costing about $122 USD.  Our source now gives us some exclusive information about the Galaxy J1 follow-ups - the Galaxy J5 and the Galaxy J7 and they shared as much information as they could regarding the two devices.
We know that both devices will sport a HD TFT LCD display with the Galaxy J5 coming in at 5-inches with a resolution of 1280 x 720 pixels.  Processing power comes from a 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 400 (MSM8916) that can be clocked up to 1.4GHz.  It will pack 1.5GB of RAM with 8GB of internal storage, although it will have a microSD card slot available for expansion.  Both devices will have either a 13MP or 8MP main camera and a 5MP FFC.  The device will be powered by a 2600mAh battery, have an 8.5 mm profile and weigh in at 149 grams.  Complete with Android Lollipop and handle 4G LTE networks.
The Galaxy J7 will sport a larger 5.5-inch HD display with either a 1.2GHz or 1.5GHz octa-core Marvel PXA1936 processor with 1.5GB of RAM and 4GB/8GB of internal storage, a microSD card slot for expansion and a 3000mAh battery.  The Galaxy J7 will only be 7.9 mm thin and weigh in at 170 grams.  It will carry either the 13MP or 8MP main camera and the larger 5MP FFC for selfies and video chatting.  It too, will come with Android Lollipop out-of-the-box and be 4G LTE ready.  No pricing is available on either the Galaxy J5 or J7 as of yet.

Samsung Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 leak reveals new mid-range smartphones
April 8, 2015
By Adam Leave a Comment
Samsung started its new naming convention last year, and since that time we've seen a number of new handsets announced under the branding. Two of the latest have just appeared in a new leak, so now we're going to get to know the Samsung Galaxy J5 and Samsung Galaxy J7.
Samsung's new naming scheme comes in tiers, and the "J series" is towards the bottom when it comes to specs while the A series it towards the top. The Samsung Galaxy J1 was made official earlier this year, and the Samsung Galaxy J5 and J7 look to follow in its midrange footsteps.
First up is the Samsung Galaxy J5 which carries the model number SM-J500F. The smartphone sports a 5-inch 720p display with one of the new 64-bit Snapdragon 410's and 1.5GB of RAM. The storage capacity is listed at 8GB, but is expandable and it will sip its power from a 2,600mAh battery. The J5 is 8.5mm thin with a weight of 149grams, and will run Android 5.0 out of the box.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 is similar to its sibling, but has a larger 5.5-inch display, and the option of 4GB or 8GB of storage. That option extends to the processor as well, as there will be a 1.2GHz or 1.5GHz octa-core Marvel PXA1936 chip under the hood. The battery is listed at 3,000mAh, but everything else essentially stays the same. Both handsets will come with a 13MP/5MP camera combo and 4G LTE, but there is a possibility that 13MP snapper will be swapped out for an 8MP one before primetime.
Samsung's new smartphones could be popular if they can keep the price down. The company knows they have to change things up to compete in the midrange market against the likes of Xiaomi, Huawei and others, and the Samsung Galaxy J5 along with the Samsung Galaxy J7 and J1 may be their way of doing just that.
Would you like to see the Samsung Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 come to your region if priced right?

Huawei P8, P8 Lite to take on Samsung Galaxy A7, A8 & J7
Huawei P8, P8 Lite to take on Samsung Galaxy A7, A8 & J7
In an attempt to move up the value chain, Huawei will introduce its latest phones in India - the high-end P series comprising the P8 and the P8lite.
HUAWEI P8 Price Rs 26k
The most interesting of all the phones is the Huawei P8 and the P8 Lite. The P8 actually has two versions - a low end and a high-end version. According to our sources, it is possible that only the lower speced version will be launched in India initially.
The Huawei P8 is the Chinese company's attempt to move into the premium market and not just focus on the entry-level segment.
However, the P8 is not a true flagship like, for example, the Sony Z sereis or the Samsung S series is. In many ways, the P8 can be compared to Huawei's own Honor 6 Plus because of its full-HD display (as opposed to a quad-HD display.)
However, unlike the Huawei Honor 6 Plus, the P8 has a 5.2 inch display.
It is powered by Huawei's in-house Kirin 630 processor, which is still being manufactured on the 28 nm process. The Kirin 640 will move to the 16 nm FinFet technology.
As mentioned earlier, there are two versions of the phone - one with 16 GB memory and another with 64 GB memory. It is not clear which one is being launched in India. Given the price, it could be either.
One of the interesting things about the phone is the front camera. Unlike other models, the P8 comes with an 8 MP shooter in the front and a 13 MP camera at the back.
Everything else, including 3 GB of RAM and 4G LTE support, are standard flagship specifications. Battery, at 2.7 Ah, is not the biggest we have seen though.
HUAWEI P8Lite Price Rs 14k
Together with the above model, Huawei will also launch the 'Lite' version of the phone, priced considerably lower. This one will come with a 720p, 5-inch display and a slower Kirin 620 processor. While the back camera remains the same on P8Lite, the front camera has been reduced to a 5 MP unit. Battery will be 2.2 Ah.
Storage memory will be 16 GB.
OUR TAKE
We believe Indian buyers may not accept 'premium' pricing from Huawei, even if the quality of the handsets are well above those of its entry-level offerings. As a result, much will depend on the actual market pricing.

Smartphone war: Samsung to launch 10 devices in the next quarter in Rs 9,000-18,000 segment
Writankar Mukherjee, ET Bureau Jun 25, 2015, 10.36AM IST
(Samsung Electronics Company.)
KOLKATA: Samsung Electronics Company, the world's biggest seller of smartphones, is planning its biggest blitzkrieg of launches in India in the next quarter in a bid to fend off local and Chinese rivals in the mid-segment category.
The South Korean company will introduce 10 smartphones in the July-September quarter in theRs 9,000 to Rs 18,000 segment, where it is embroiled in a fierce battle for market share with Micromax Informatics, Lenovo-Motorola and Xiaomi. According to some research companies, the rivalry led to a drop in Samsung's market share in the high-stakes mid-segment in 2014.
Over the past few quarters, Samsung has launched mostly variants of older models such as Galaxy Grand and Galaxy Core in this segment, which have failed to stand up to competition. The new strategy is championed by Samsung India president HyunChil Hong, who took over in December. Smartphones account for 70% of the company's revenue in India.
This will be Samsung's largest rollout of unique models in India, according to three senior trade executives, who have been informed about the latest move by company officials and distributors.
"We do not comment on market speculation," a Samsung India spokesperson said in response to an email sent by ET. "However, Samsung is committed to the Indian market and will continue to cater to the needs of consumers with innovative products and technology."
Most of the new models will be introduced under a sub-brand called the J series and the 4G-compliant handsets will be made in India. Two models, Galaxy J7 and J5, are expected to be the first to hit store shelves early next month.
"After beating Apple in the premium smartphone segment last quarter, Samsung is now looking at extending its lead in the overall market by filling the gap with a new line-up in the Rs 9,000-18,000 segment and would spend hugely on promotions," the CEO of a leading electronics retail chain said, asking not to be identified.
The Korean giant will also launch its next flagship model, the Galaxy Note 5, in India in September, ahead of Apple's traditional iPhone launch and in time for the festive season.
The mid-segment accounts for 30% of smartphone sales by volume in India and is second only to the entry-level category, which has 35% of sales, according to Hong Kong-based Counterpoint Technology Market Research. TheRs 9,000-18,000 segment is the fastest growing and expected to become the largest in the next two quarters.
Samsung has strongly contested data by market trackers Canalys, based in the UK, and CMR India, which show that the Korean company lost ground in this category to Gurgaon-based Micromax.
Samsung's share in the Indian smartphone market fell from 43.2% to 23.7% in 2014 as Micromax, Karbonn and Intex gained, according to CMR India data. However, in the January-March quarter, Samsung bounced back with a 27.9% share after boosting its presence in the entry and premium segments, while Micromax was second with 16.2%, CMR India said. Analysts and retailers said the two smartphone makers are in close competition with each other and Chinese brands.
Samsung positions its smartphones more on overall experience, while its Indian and Chinese rivals highlight features such as 4G connectivity, battery capacity and screen resolution to grab the attention of consumers, according to Tarun Pathak, a senior analyst at Counterpoint. "Chinese and Indian brands have a faster time to market than Samsung, which allows them to adapt faster.
However, Samsung still has one of the most robust distribution reaches in India compared to any other vendor, but it needs to have a faster time to market along with aggressive presence in online channels, which it seems to be doing now," Pathak said.

Samsung Galaxy J7 in India con Exynos 7580 al posto di S615
17 Luglio 2015 11
Scheda Tecnica
Nella giornata di ieri, Samsung ha ufficializzato i due nuovi device della serie J, Galaxy J5 e Galaxy J7 , anche in India, a distanza di circa un mese dalla Cina . Si è scoperto che il più largo Galaxy J7 monta un SoC diverso da quello della variante cinese, un Exynos 7580 al posto dello Snapdragon 615 di Qualcomm.
A livello tecnico i due chip non differiscono moltissimo: entrambi sono octa-core, e sfruttano l'architettura Cortex-A53 di ARM. La GPU è invece diversa, naturalmente: Adreno 405 per Qualcomm, ARM Mali-T720 MP2 per Exynos.
Nonostante la somiglianza, abbiamo avuto modo di vedere nei benchmark di Galaxy S5 Neo come la soluzione di Samsung riesca a battere agevolmente Qualcomm sia nei test single-core che in quelli multi-core | I primi benchmark di Galaxy S5 Neo mostrano risultati interessanti per Exynos 7580 |. C'è da dire che i benchmark facevano riferimento a un processore con clock di 1.60 GHz, mentre nel caso di Galaxy J7 ci si ferma a 1.5 GHz.
Difficile stabilire quale versione arriverà in Europa, anche se visti i precedenti è più facile ipotizzare quella con Snapdragon. Il resto delle caratteristiche è invariato.

Samsung Introducing New Smartphones For India
July 8, 2015 - Written By David Steele
India is a market that the world's smartphone manufacturers cannot ignore. It is currently one of the fastest growing smartphone markets in the world and is set to overtake the United States of America in smartphones sales by 2017. This strong growth, which showed an increase of 21% in the first quarter of 2015 compared with Q1 2014, is underpinned by India's developing economy and strong increase in the number of online users. The smartphone is a simple and highly portable way to get online, requiring relatively little in terms of infrastructure compared with fixed line broadband. The potential of the Indian market is not being ignored by domestic companies and there are several producing devices for the local market. As such, the Indian market has evolved quickly leaving many of the international smartphone manufacturers struggling to keep up. The bigger selling devices are the lower priced, entry level to mid range devices: four out of every five smartphones sold belongs in these camps. It's here we are seeing many new models, some with innovative and stand-out features, most recently in the battery capacity department . However, Samsung has maintained the top spot in the market since it first started selling smartphones. In Q1 2015, it had almost 26% of the market, outperforming second place Indian manufacturer, Micromax, which managed a little under 20%.
Samsung, however, are not resting on their laurels. Their low and mid-range device face stiff competition from local (Indian) manufacturers plus a myriad of Chinese companies, many of which are investing in Indian manufacturing plants driven by the Indian government's "Make in India" campaign. This has certainly helped Samsung as their third largest smartphone factory is based in India. We have also seen plans from Samsung to build another factory in the region with an investment of $100 million, although it will manufacture the flagship Galaxy S6 family of devices. Samsung is consolidating its position as the number one in the market by introducing a number of new lower to mid range models, specifically in the J-series. We are expecting the Galaxy J2, Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 to be introduced in September. These smartphones will go head to head with low cost, high specification competitor models such as the Xiaomi Redmi 2, Lenovo A7000 and YU Yuphoria.
It will be interesting to see how the Galaxy J models line up compared with the other lower and mid-range models in the Samsung portfolio, these being the Galaxy A and Galaxy E devices. The J series are currently sold for prices ranging from around $90 up to approximately $220 and are the cheapest LTE-equipped devices in the Samsung portfolio. We have also seen Samsung experimenting with other devices, such as the first Tizen OS handset, the Z1, which was introduced in January. With new production facilities boosting the existing plant, a range of new devices and a willingness to experiment, Samsung appears to have all of the tools it needs to compete with the competition. And with the Indian smartphone market being so significant, the stakes are potentially high.

Novo modelo do Galaxy J3 é importado para a Índia e passa por benchmark
23 de outubro de 2015 9:05h
 
 
A Samsung anunciou no início deste ano que diminuiria o número de dispositivos lançados, buscando assim reduzir a sua fama de "franco-atiradora". Aparentemente isto ficou apenas no discurso, já que apenas em 2015 foram lançadas dúzias de modelos mundo afora, algo que pelo visto não irá parar tão cedo. Após o lançamento dos Galaxy J1 , J1 Ace , J2 , J5 e J7 , surgem novas informações agora sobre o Galaxy J3, que viria como mais uma opção para o já saturado mercado de baixo custo.
Desta vez o misterioso smartphone foi flagrado no teste de benchmark GFXBench sob o modelo SM-J320, possuindo especificações técnicas superiores ao que foi visto no início deste mês no mesmo teste com a versão SM-J3109 , demonstrando que mais uma vez teremos um mar de variantes voltadas para cada território ao redor do globo. De acordo com a ficha liberada e com o que vimos anteriormente, o Galaxy J3 terá as seguintes características:
Tela de 5 polegadas com resolução HD (720 x 1280 pixels)
Chipset Spreadtrum SC8830 Quad-Core com clock máximo em 1,5GHz
GPU ARM Mali-400 MP2
8GB de armazenamento interno (4,8GB disponíveis para o usuário)
Câmera principal de 8MP
Câmera frontal de 5MP
Android 5.1.1 Lollipop
Além disso, tivemos a importação de vários componentes relacionados ao novo smartphone para a Índia, o que pode ser visto diretamente no banco de dados do Zauba. Isto significa que a Samsung pode apresentar o modelo em breve no país, procurando assim aumentar ainda mais a sua participação no mercado indiano, onde já lidera há algum tempo.
Como a Samsung ainda não se pronunciou sobre a existência do Galaxy J3, resta apenas aguardarmos que mais detalhes sejam disponibilizados para que possamos saber quando o dispositivo será de fato anunciado e em que países ele estará disponível para venda. Considerando que a sul-coreana tem investido pesado em mercados como Índia, Brasil e China para aumentar sua participação, principalmente nas faixas mais baixas de preço, é bastante provável que vejamos o novo modelo primeiro nestes locais, sendo apenas uma questão de tempo até que ele seja apresentado oficialmente.

Samsung has launched the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 in June as a bold attempt of the Korean tech giant to regain its market share in the mid-range smartphone market that it once held firmly well.
Just like its grasp on the high-end smartphone market not too long ago, Samsung eventually lost it with its own doing when it released the Samsung Galaxy S5 in March last year with hardly any major improvement from its high-end flagship smartphone of 2013, the Samsung Galaxy S4.
As a result, the Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus swallowed the Samsung Galaxy S5 in whole not to mention a significant portion of the Korean tech giant's high-end smartphone market share.
But Samsung bounced back this year big time with the launching of the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge to redeem itself and eventually recover lost ground, and more importantly, its market share in the high-end smartphone market.
The Korean tech giant did great in making that huge turnaround with the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge. Three months later, Samsung wanted to do the same in the mid-range smartphone market, thus launching the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5.
Same bland design
While Samsung has promised a complete makeover of its entire smartphone lineup this year, the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 actually came out with the same bland designs of the previous Samsung mid-range handsets.
Compared for example with the Huawei P8lite, the Galaxy S7 actually struggles to even deserve a second look, notes Neurogadget.
The Chinese smartphone maker has obviously come out with a beautiful-looking smartphone for the mid-range market, which many critics believe as the hands down title contender for the best designed mid-range smartphone of 2015.
What the Samsung Galaxy J7 lack in design and aesthetics, however, it actually made up for it with features that the Korean tech giant has been known to deliver on its mobile devices.
Both the Galaxy J7 and the Galaxy J5 look more like every other Galaxy smartphones in the market. They both feature anodized bodies, shiny, cheap-looking faux-metal side bezels, and the same monotonous overall design profile.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 actually looks a lot like the Samsung Galaxy Mega 6.3 launched in 2013, whose problem then was being too slippery to grasp on the hands.
A response to the mid-range smartphone leaders
The Samsung Galaxy J5 and the Samsung Galaxy J7 actually signal the Korean tech giant's response to the heavy hitters in the global mid-range handset currently dominated by Motorola, Sony, Xiaomi, among other players.
Although it is affordably priced just like the other mid-range smartphones including the Xiaomi Mi 4i, the Motorola Moto G 2nd Generation, the Sony Xperia E 4G, among several others, Samsung has evidently raised the bar in the market with the superb specifications and features of its Galaxy J series smartphones, notes NDTV Gadgets.
The mid-range smartphones both run on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out of the box and both came out on its home market in South Korea followed by its biggest market in China, before making it to India in July and other Asian markets.
Just like the Samsung Galaxy S6 and the Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge, Samsung launched the Samsung Galaxy J7 and the Samsung Galaxy J5 to validate its reputation for simultaneously launching products that are almost similarly priced and carry almost the same features.
However, the Samsung Galaxy J7 is the more top-of-the-line variant between the two and reports have it that when it was launched in China in June and in India in July, it has stirred a storm in the midrange market segment.
The Galaxy J7 is larger than the Galaxy J5 with its 5.5-inch screen compared to the latter's 5-inch display screen. However, both have the same 720 x 1280-pixel resolution
In terms of power under the hood, the Galaxy J7 is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 610 chipset while the Galaxy J5 features the slightly inferior Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor. The Snapdragon 610 is an octa-core processor while the Snapdragon 410 is only quad-core.

For years, there have been accusations that Samsung has been selling phones with lesser specs for higher price. This saw it being overshadowed by the likes of Micromax, Xiaomi and OnePlus.
After some botched efforts with its online exclusive models, the Korean giant is back in the business with J7 and J5 4G-enabled smartphones. J5 is priced at Rs. 11,999, while J7 a bit costlier with a price tag of Rs. 14,999
At the onset the company is offering a superior specifications compared to its higher-priced mid-ranged smartphones exclusively on Flipkart.
One of the highlights of both the devices is the 5MP front facing camera LED flash, which is aimed at the selfie lovers.
Galaxy J5 features 8GB of storage and houses a 5-inch 720p HD display, and runs on the combination of a 1.2GHz quad core Snapdragon 410 processor and 1.5GB of RAM. A 2600mAh battery and a 13MP camera are two of its other important attributes.
The Samsung Galaxy J7 on the other hand goes for a 5.5-inch 720p display. It possesses a 1.5GHz octa core Exynos 7580 CPU, apart from 1.5GB of RAM. There's 16GB of storage onboard as well, apart from a 13MP camera and a 3000mAh battery.
The sales numbers of these phones will also have an impact on the online strategy of Samsung. Despite being the highest selling smartphone in India, it has struggled when it comes to online sales.
Samsung is also wooing users with a lot of freebies. While there will be free in game credits worth Rs 3200 for top titles, Airtel is giving buyers a double data offer as well as access to music worth Rs 594 over six months.
It looks like Samsung will continue to struggle as Lenovo, Xiaomi and Motorola offer smartphones with superior specifications in the same price ranges. There are a few newcomers like InFocus who have recently entered the market and the Korean giant will face some stiff resistance. 


MOSCOW: As Samsung eyeing to launch its flagship smartphone Samsung Galaxy J7, now the device made an appearance on company's official website.  
The information about the Galaxy J7 was leaked through Samsung's official website.
Its specifications were surfaced through TENAA. Now, the device has been listed on an online retailer's website in Russia along with its specifications.
According to the specifications listed on the website, the Galaxy J7 will feature a 5.5-inch HD display, Android 5.0 Lollipop, an octa-core PXA1936 processor from Marvel clocked at 1.2GHz, 16GB storage, and a microSD card slot.
These specifications match what we mentioned in Sammobile exclusive report. It is expected to be equipped with 1.5GB RAM, a 13-megapixel primary camera, a 5-megapixel secondary camera, and a 3,000 mAh battery.
Last month, images of the device were revealed through TENAA certification.
Also, leaked official manual of the Galaxy J7 confirmed that the device will feature a new version of TouchWiz that debuted with the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge.

Samsung Z3 to offer AMOLED display, 1 GB RAM at Rs 8,490 India price
Samsung Z3 to offer AMOLED display, 1 GB RAM at Rs 8,490 India price
ENTRY-LEVEL SMARTPHONES , SAMSUNG , TIZEN
The upcoming Samsung Z3, the Korean giant's second phone based on the Tizen operating system, will offer decent mid-range specifications at a jaw-dropping price of just Rs 8,490.
The price makes the Z3 the cheapest phone with an AMOLED display. However, the downside to the model is the Spreadtrum SC7730S chipset, which doesn't have 4G.
The highlight of the phone is a 5-inch 720p AMOLED display. At present, 4G phones with HD AMOLED displays, such as the Panasonic Eluga Z , are priced at Rs 13,500 and above. The HTC One E9s, whose specifications are very close to the leaked specifications of the Samsung Z3, will be priced around Rs 22,000 in India.
Similarly, the Micromax Canvas Knight 2, which also comes with 4G and an HD AMOLED display, is priced at Rs 15,000 in India.
The phone has a battery with a capacity of of 2.6 Ah, 8 GB of internal memory, 1 GB of RAM and supports MicroSD cards of up to 128 GB.
The phone will be available on Snapdeal starting next week.
The high cost of the traditional retail channel has been a key area of weakness for Samsung as the company does not go for 'online only' launches like main competitors Lenovo, Huawei, Motorola and Xiaomi.
Online only model means that the phone's distribution cost can be kept to just Rs 500 or even less than that. In the traditional model, distribution and dealer costs come to a few thousand rupees.
Largely because of this, Samsung's phones have come out to be more costly compared to those from Lenovo and Xiaomi.
For example, the upcoming Galaxy J7 is likely to be priced around Rs 15,000, while the Lenovo K3 Note, which has better specifications than the Samsung model, is priced at Rs 9,999 on Flipkart.
However, it is more difficult for an established brand like Samsung to restrict its models to 'online only' as doing so will affect its relationships with distributors and dealers who account for most of its current sales.
Even Microsoft (Nokia), which has one of the most entrenched partnerships with distributors and dealers in India, was forced to go with 'online only' model for its Lumia 640 phone to beat back aggressive low-cost competitors.
The Tizen OS is reported to be lighter than Android. As a result, the phones run snappier. But the 'lightness' comes at a price - application support. Many popular apps do not run on Tizen OS, and this has led to negative customer feedback about the first phone Z1, currently available at Rs 4,990 on Amazon.
Microsoft Lumia 950 XL India launch could miss Diwali, price above Rs 55k; 550 cheapest For all practical purposes, Microsoft's Lumia brand has been dead in the Indian market for the last six months.  At present, the highest-rated phone from the company is the Lumia 930, a 3G-only phone priced at Rs 38,000 and launched more than a year ago.

5 major smartphone launches taking place in India next week
By Maitrayee Iyer on Jul 24, 2015 at 6:10 PM
Mobile
July has already seen a bunch of major launches, including the likes of  Samsung's Galaxy J5 and Galaxy J7 , and the recently launched  Yu Yureka Plus . The month is looking at ending with a similar bang, and the last week of July is jam-packed with new launches. Listed below are five major smartphone launches taking place in India next week.
Lava Android One smartphone
On Monday, Lava is hosting a launch event where it is widely expected to  launch the first of the next-generation Android One smartphones . A mysterious  Lava smartphone called the Iris X5 4G  has been spotted online that could be the Android One smartphone.
It is said to feature a 4.6-inch HD (1280×720 pixels) display, 1.3GHz MediaTek MT6735 quad-core processor, 2GB of RAM, 16GB internal storage, 12-megapixel rear camera, 7-megapixel selfie camera, LTE support, and on the software front, runs on Android 5.1 out-of-the box.
Micromax's ultra-affordable smartphone
BGR India today learnt  that Micromax is planning on launched an ultra-affordable smartphone next week. Details are sketchy at best, but a leaked photo hints at a smartphone with a metallic frame. Unfortunately that's about all that we know about the smartphone. Another thing that we do know is that Micromax's forthcoming smartphone will retail on Flipkart.
OnePlus 2
This is easily one of the most anticipated smartphones, and it will be launched on July 28 via a virtual reality event. Later in the day, the Chinese company is hosting a launch event in New Delhi to no doubt reveal Indian pricing and availability details.
OnePlus has already revealed quite a lot about the smartphone. It will be powered by an  improved version of the Snapdragon 810 processor, and feature  USB Type C port ,  fingerprint sensor,    a 3,300mAh battery, faster LTE , and dual-SIM card support. Rumors claim that the smartphone will also feature a 5.5-inch full HD (1920×1080 pixels) display,  13-megapixel rear camera  with laser auto focus and a 5-megapixel front-facing camera. The company has also confirmed that the OnePlus 2 will be priced between $320 and $450.
Motorola Moto G (2015)
On the same day, Motorola too is hosting a launch event in New Delhi, where it is expected to unveil its third generation smartphones. One of them is the mid-range Moto G (2015), and a promo video from earlier in the day has revealed nearly everything worth knowing about the smartphone.
It is expected to feature a 5-inch HD display, 1.7GHz Snapdragon 410 quad-core SoC, 2GB of RAM, and 8GB internal storage that can be expanded using a microSD card. Also set to be included are 13-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel front-facing camera, 2,470mAh battery, and IPx7 certification making it water resistant. On the software front, it will run on Android 5.1.1 out-of-the-box. Adding to the long list of leaks is  yet another report hinting  that the Moto G (2015) will be priced around Rs 13,700.
Motorola Moto X (2015)
In addition to the Moto G, Motorola could also unveil the third generation of its flagship Moto X. From what we have head so far, it is  expected  to flaunt a 5.64-inch QHD display, and will be powered by a Snapdragon 808 chipset paired with 3GB of RAM. It is also likely to feature a 16-megapixel rear camera, 5-megapixel selfie camera, USB Type C port, 3,280mAh battery and will run on Android 5.1.1 Lollipop out-of-the-box.

Samsung Galaxy A8 to succeed A7 next month, price Rs 30k in India
Samsung Galaxy A8 to succeed A7 next month, price Rs 30k in India
HIGH-END SMARTPHONES , SAMSUNG
Samsung Galaxy A8 is getting ready to replace the current upper-end phone A7 early next month in India at a price of around Rs 30,000, according to a Delhi-based Samsung distributor.
The pictures of Galaxy A8 have already been leaked on a French website , and shows that the phone is already very close to commercial production (see their picture below, comparing the new phone with the predecessor).
The A8 (and later, Galaxy A9) are the upgrades to the A series launched late last year and early this year, but the difference between the A7 and A8 will not be remarkable.
On the other hand, the A9 is likely to come with a quad-HD display and be priced in the Rs 36,000 range.
For now, it's the specifications of the A8 that have been revealed. At Rs 30,000, the phone will only be about Rs 4,500 costlier than the A7. That is still cheaper than the launch price of the A7.
The A7, which was launched at Rs 31,000 in January, is currently selling for Rs 26,000, and can be expected to fall to about Rs 25,500 by the time the A8 is launched in India. The price would have fallen even more but for the decline in the value of the Indian rupee against foreign currencies.
Anyway, for that extra Rs 4,500 that you pay over the A7's price, you get the following improvements:
a) Better rear camera: The A8 comes with a 16 MP shooter at the back, while the A7 has a 13 MP one.
b) Better looks: The A8 definitely looks more stylish. While the A7 looked more squarish, the A8 looks more longish, and the silver gril around the sides are less pronounced. The edges are more curvy, which is the reason why it looks less squarish compared to the A7. In many ways, the new model reminds one of the Galaxy S6.
c) Bigger display: The display of the Galaxy A8 is 7.4% bigger in area than that of the earlier model and has a diagonal length of 5.7 inches vs 5.5 inch on the earlier model. That said, resolution remains the same at full-HD, and technology is also the same - Super AMOLED.
d) Android 5 Lolipop: A much needed upgrade. With this, the new phone will finally bring the Lolipop update to the A series.
e) Slight bigger, 3050 mAh battery compared to 2.6 Ah battery on the earlier model.
f) A fingerprint sensor for easier unlocking and added security.
Do keep in mind that the A series will not have all the top features that Samsung wants to put into its phones. That privilege is reserved for its 'S' series.
As a result, the A8 is also likely to have 16 GB of internal storage, 2 GB of RAM and come with the mid-range Snapdragon 615 chipset.
At 5.7 inches, quad-HD resolution (4 mln pixels) would have added some crispness to the display compared to a full-HD (2 mln pixel) screen, though there is very little difference at 5 inches.
However, compared to prices of Rs 40,000 plus for the S series, a discount of Rs 10,000 definitely makes this phone a value offering, especially considering that many people can't make out any difference between a full HD display and a quad HD display even at 5.5 inches.
While distributors expect Samsung to unveil both the A8 and the A9 at the same time next month, going by past record, there may not be an official launch ceremony, and the phones may simply 'trickle in'.
The A7 has been one of the most successful launches for the Korean company in recent years. The phone has successfully taken on competition in the upper mid range from other MNC brands.
The A7 has reportedly outsold the HTC Desire 826, which is slightly cheaper than the Korean model.
Microsoft Lumia 950 XL India launch could miss Diwali, price above Rs 55k; 550 cheapest For all practical purposes, Microsoft's Lumia brand has been dead in the Indian market for the last six months.  At present, the highest-rated phone from the company is the Lumia 930, a 3G-only phone priced at Rs 38,000 and launched more than a year ago.

by Jamshed Avari , 13 April 2015
It's been a tumultuous year for Samsung.  Buoyant and complacent with being the world's most successful Android  smartphone vendor for ages, the Korean giant was perhaps not prepared  for its Galaxy S5 flagship last year to be so roundly criticised for not  breaking any new ground. The heart rate sensor was pretty much mostly a  gimmick, and the glossy plastic body did it no favours when seen next  to its competition. Chinese brands have started having an impact on  its low-end and mid-range sales, and Lollipop updates for older devices  have been coming too slowly, if at all.
Samsung's image has lost a  lot of its former sheen; even more so when it comes to the top-end  Galaxy S range. Under more pressure than ever before, the company is  betting on a major reinvention. Gone is the cheap plastic, in favour of  slick aluminium. Gone is the heavy TouchWiz skin with dozens of settings  and features that no one ever used - the software is more restrained than ever.
We first saw the new Samsung Galaxy S6 (and its eclectic curved-glass twin, the Galaxy S6 Edge )  shortly after its launch at the 2015 Mobile World Congress show, but  now we've had enough time to conduct a full, thorough review. The device  is launching in India just over a month after its global debut, making  it the first of this year's flagship models to make it here.  Should you  rush out and buy one?
Look and feel
Samsung has been  experimenting with metal bodies up and down its product lineup, so it's  no surprise that the new flagship model comes in full aluminium trim.  Samsung's phones have been difficult to tell apart in the past because  of the company's very set template, and the Galaxy S6 feels like something of a  missed opportunity in terms of a breakout design. With new materials and new  priorities, Samsung could have gone in exciting directions but the  Galaxy S6 not only carries forward most of its predecessors' style, it  somehow simultaneously manages to look like it has borrowed cues from Sony and Apple .
While the influence of the iPhone 6 ( Review | Pictures ) and its predecessors is apparent in  details such as the machined speaker grille and chamfered rim edges, we  find that the overall shape and style feel more derivative of the Sony  Xperia Z3 ( Review | Pictures ). Other touches, such as the silver-rimmed physical Home button  are pure Samsung.
The front and back are flat glass, and the  metal rim has a slight curve that fits nicely in a hand. Thankfully, the Galaxy S5 ( Review | Pictures ) rim's ugly ridges were smoothened out. The power button and  Nano-SIM tray are on the right, and two separate volume buttons are on  the left. The only things on top are an IR emitter and secondary mic,  while the speaker, Micro-USB port and headset socket are all on the  bottom. Flaps over the ports and slots for waterproofing are  conspicuously absent. The home button has an integrated fingerprint  reader and there's also a heart rate sensor right beneath the flash on  the rear.
Samsung has clearly shifted its priorities as far as  design is concerned, and this is the first Galaxy S model not to have an  accessible battery. Also as a consequence, there's no room for a  microSD card slot - you'll have to choose a storage capacity at the time  of purchase and then live with that much.
The biggest problem  with the design is that this phone is extremely slippery. We often found  ourselves uncertain of our grip on it; holding it extra tight to  compensate. The camera module sticks out quite a bit from the rear -  it's larger and more obtrusive than the infamous one on the iPhone 6 ,  and the Galaxy S6 wobbles when you try to use it lying face up on a table.
Specifications
The  fact that Samsung has gone with its in-house Exynos processor for all  global versions of the Galaxy S6 signals the company's growing  confidence in its ability to compete with top-tier technology firms such  as Qualcomm. The Exynos 7420 SoC has four 1.5GHz ARM Cortex A53 cores  and four 2.1GHz Cortex A57 cores, allowing the phone to strike a balance  between performance and power consumption for all kinds of tasks.  There's 3GB of RAM, which is standard for top-end phones now.
With  no microSD card slot, Samsung has made the Galaxy S6 available in  multiple storage configurations. The strategy and pricing follow Apple's  precedents, but the base model comes with 32GB rather than 16GB, which  seems like a direct shot across the bow.
Predictably, the screen  moves up to QHD resolution, which is 1440x2560 pixels. At 5.1 inches  diagonally, it's a lot easier to handle than last year's QHD flagships.  The screen is beautifully crisp and bright, and it's protected by  Gorilla Glass 4.
Like last year's Galaxy S5, the physical Home  button has an integrated fingerprint sensor, but now you don't have to  swipe your finger across it - a simple touch will do. The heart rate  sensor on the rear is also still around. We found the one on the Galaxy  S5 gimmicky and ultimately forgettable. This one is positioned to one  side of the camera hump, making less likely that regular usage will  become a habit.
Software
Samsung has famously reduced a lot  of the software clutter that defined its Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5  devices. TouchWiz has tried to mimic some of Google's Lollipop-era  Material Design aesthetic and it is a marked improvement over previous  Samsung attempts at UI design. Responsiveness isn't a problem, and we  never got the feeling that any of the customisations were a step  backwards from stock Android.
There are some things that you might  never use, but are fairly unobtrusive and can be disabled, such as the  Fliboard-style news reader to the left of the primary home screen, and  the ability to run two apps simultaneously in a split-screen mode. The  quick settings and notifications shade is handy - for example, grabbing  the brightness slider makes all other controls temporarily disappear  from the screen, letting you see how your adjustment will affect the  underlying app or content.
Interestingly, there's now a Themes  app and an associated online store from which you can download packs  that give your Galaxy S6 UI a complete visual overhaul. We noticed a few  branded options, so presumably Samsung is open to licensing deals. We  hope to see more variety in the store soon .
There are still  significant amounts of Samsung-branded bloat, such as the Galaxy  Essentials and Galaxy Gifts apps and widget. It looks like a bunch of  apps such as Facebook, Facebook Messenger, Whatsapp and Instagram are  preloaded, but these icons take you do download pages which means they  aren't taking up as much space by default. You also get the Peel Smart  Remote app with which to use the IR blaster.
Of course one of the  biggest stories here is the default inclusion of Microsoft apps and  services , right in Google's stronghold. Skype, OneDrive and OneNote are  preloaded, though not the Microsoft Office apps which would compete  directly with Google's offerings. OneNote is fantastically useful and  any use of OneDrive is a toe-hold for the company. Any more than this  and users would have been faced with confusing choices.
S-Health  is still around, tied in to the heart rate monitor on the rear but more  realistically useful if you have a smartwatch or dedicated monitoring  device. The app lists compatible accessories including of course the  Samsung Gear range, plus devices from Garmin, Adidas and others. We  didn't wind up getting much use out of S-Health during our review  period, but it will probably be useful over time to those who make it  part of their daily routine.
Camera
Flagship phones today  are distinguished by their cameras, and the Samsung Galaxy S6 does very  well indeed in this department. We were constantly amazed by the quality  of photos we were able to take, and the accuracy of subtle little  details. Daylight shots were extraordinarily impressive, especially when  we were able to frame shots to get some depth of field. Close-ups  revealed that the camera can reproduce fine textures and really make  colours pop.
We were satisfied with the compression and noise  levels too, even in low light. While ambient lighting made a huge  difference to the colour accuracy of shots and the autofocus was often  unreliable at night, we were more than impressed with the results we  were able to capture. We have only seen better low-light results from  the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus.
(Click to see full size)
4K video came out well, though we  still feel that there aren't many occasions on which 4K makes more  sense than regular 1080p - especially if you go for the lowest-priced  32GB model. A 30-second 4K clip came to around 170MB, while an  equivalent 1080p clip took up just 60MB. The phone warns you that some  features, such as continuous autofocus and still grabs aren't possible  while recording in 4K, and we also found this to be the only time when  the phone really got hot in our hands.
Samsung's camera app has  also undergone a significant makeover. The massive grid of settings has  been distilled into a few options on screen, with a deeper menu for  things that spill over. A manual mode lets you drag sliders to adjust the focus and exposure compensation, which is really neat.
(Click to see full size)
There's a modular approach to features - a  "Camera Mode store" lets you add things that aren't already there, such  as a mode for sports or fast-moving objects, one for food, a face  beautifier, dual-cam PIP, and many more fringe use cases. It's a lot  better than having a thousand options by default, and we wonder if paid  camera software enhancements are on the way.
Performance
Samsung  clearly believes its Exynos processors are mature enough to bet the  entire flagship Galaxy S line on, and we found that its confidence is  not misplaced. The Galaxy S6 will go up against multiple devices powered  by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 810, but for now it can enjoy the first  mover's advantage as we can't compare the two processors yet.
Benchmark  scores were some of the highest we've ever seen - the AnTuTu score of  67,975 was significantly higher than our previous record, 52,686 set by  the Motorola Moto Turbo. Quadrant returned 34,417 points overall. Both  scores are significantly better than the Galaxy S5 managed to achieve.
Even  more interestingly, GFXBench ran at 39fps and 3DMark's Ice Storm  Unlimited test achieved 21,878 points. That means despite the  pixel-dense screen, there's more than enough graphics horsepower to let  you run today's most demanding games at adequate frame rates. Video  playback performance is just fine, and even the speaker is crisp and  clear despite being shoved into such a slim body.
The battery  lasted 13 hours, 8 minutes in our standard video loop test. This should  easily translate to a full day of heavy usage, including cellular data  and games. The phone also charges very quickly, which is a feature  everyone can appreciate.
Verdict
We mostly approve of  Samsung's new direction. The company has clearly identified why the  Galaxy S5 didn't look so great against its competitors, and has taken  steps to rectify every problem. The Galaxy S6 is perfectly in line with  what we expect a 2015 flagship phone to be. It isn't perfect, but  there's seemingly a workaround for every problem: a 128GB version for  those who need storage space; downloadable components for features that  were dropped; slick features that don't make the software feel  excessive.
The Galaxy S6 is still a little bland in terms of  style, but at least it doesn't feel like an ugly toy. Only the camera  bulge is a real problem, though for the quality we're getting, we can  live with it. You'll want a protective case anyway, which will somewhat  tone down the bulge.
If you're in the market for a top-end Android  phone with a reasonably sized screen and cost is not a limiting factor,  there's really nothing to beat the Galaxy S6 at this moment. If you can  hold on for a little while, we'd suggest waiting till HTC , LG and  possibly Sony launch their own competitors. If style is more important  than anything else, the Galaxy S6 Edge has all the same features and  advantages.
Also worth noting, the Galaxy S5 has dropped to  nearly half of its launch price and is just a year old. Flagships don't  age in terms of specifications and capabilities, and so the S5 is a  viable alternative. If you want an Android experience that's closer to  stock, you could also consider the Motorola Moto Turbo ( Review | Pictures ).


National Encryption Policy: Government Issues Clarification on WhatsApp, Social Media
by Sriram Sharma and Gopal Sathe , 21 September 2015
If a draft proposal by government's Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) becomes the law in its current form, you might be asked to retain certain forms of digital communication for a period of 90 days.
Update 22 September 1:40am: The government issued an addendum to clarify that "mass use encryption products, which are currently being used in web applications, social media sites, and social media applications such as WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter etc." While that language is vague in itself, you can rest easy without needing to worry about having to store your WhatsApp messages for 90 days. The original text continues below.
The DeitY has posted a draft National Encryption Policy on its website inviting comments from the public on its mission, strategies, objectives, and regulatory framework, which you can send to akrishnan@deity.gov.in, until 16th October 2015. A lot of the details mentioned in the draft guidelines are worrying, and this is a topic that concerns every consumer.
While the draft encryption policy's preamble starts by talking about improving e-governance and e-commerce through better security and privacy measures, it very quickly brings up national security as well, and that's where things get worrying from a consumer's perspective. It's very reminiscent of when the Indian government was thinking about banning BBM in India unless BlackBerry (then Research in Motion) gave security agencies access to snoop on emails . The two would eventually reach an arrangement that allowed the government to intercept email .
The language of the new draft policy is quite clear on one thing - businesses and consumers may use encryption for storage and communication, but the encryption algorithms and key sizes will be prescribed by the Indian government. What's more, vendors of encryption products would have to register in India (with the exception of mass use products, such as SSL), and citizens are allowed to use only the products registered in India.
"Would OpenPGP, a commonly-used standard for encryption of email, fall under 'mass use'?" asks Pranesh Prakash, Policy Director at the Centre for Internet and Society, speaking to Gadgets 360. "Because if it doesn't, I am prohibited from using it. But if it does, I am required to copy-paste all my encrypted mails into a separate document to store it in plain text, as required by the draft policy. Is that what it really intends? Has the government thought this through?"
Most people don't explicitly use encryption, but it's built into apps they use every day. Do the draft guidelines also extend to products and services with built-in encryption like WhatsApp? If yes - and the language certainly suggests it does - then combine them with governments requirements for its citizens, as proposed in the draft guidelines, and we could have very worrying scenarios.
The draft guidelines read "All citizens (C), including personnel of Government/ Business (G/B) performing non-official/ personal functions, are required to store the plaintexts of the corresponding encrypted information for 90 days from the date of transaction and provide the verifiable Plain Text to Law and Enforcement Agencies as and when required as per the provision of the laws of the country."
WhatsApp messages are now encrypted end-to-end . So do the draft guidelines mean you have to store a copy of all your WhatsApp messages for 90 days? What about Snapchat? Or any other form of ephemeral messaging that is automatically deleted after being read? The consumer is expected to maintain plain text copies of all communications for 90 days - so that these can be produced if required by the laws of the land - so, will it even legal to read a message that deletes itself, if and when the draft guidelines become law?
The draft policy document states that the vision is to create an information security environment, and secure transactions. But the actual details mentioned in the draft appear to do the opposite, and put a focus more on the lines of limiting encryption only to technologies that likely could be intercepted by the government, when required.
This is in many ways similar to the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India's draft letter on Net Neutrality, which instead talked about issues like cyberbullying and 'sexting' . In the feedback period, Trai received over 1 million emails . but the Department of Telecom report on Net Neutrality also went against public sentiment on certain things, suggesting that telcos should be allowed to charge extra for specific services , such as Skype or WhatsApp voice calls in India, showing that calls for feedback aren't necessarily being taken seriously.
And, with the draft National Encryption Policy, another problem that is shared with the Net Neutrality discussions , is the use of vague language. The result is that there is very little clarity at this point on what will and will not be permitted by the government if the draft guidelines are adopted. We're living in a time when the government talks about how WhatsApp and Gmail may be used by "anti-national elements", and even considered requiring Twitter and Facebook to establish servers in India .
With that in mind, you have to ask, will it be even legal to use WhatsApp if these guidelines are implemented? After all, WhatsApp messages have end-to-end encryption and if this service does not register in India, and comply with the algorithms prescribed by the government, then as a citizen of India, you won't be allowed to use it because "users in India are allowed to use only the products registered in India," as per the draft guidelines.
If the draft policy comes into affect, businesses need to provide the plain text message, and the encrypted pair, to verify that the intercepted encrypted communication is indeed the same as the plain text message that they are providing to law enforcement or intelligence agencies, when asked as per the laws of the country.
"There is an assumption here, that given the same plain text, you always get the encrypted text. This assumption is wrong," Prakash says. "It holds for some forms of encryption, but does not necessarily hold for all forms of encryption. If there's a changing salt, it won't lead to the same encrypted text each time."
Prakash also argues against the draft specifying the hashing mechanisms, algorithm, and the key length. He says the government should instead be setting a minimum encryption strength for various sectors, like financial data, health data, or governmental use, adding that algorithms cited were outdated and broken.
"Of the 3 symmetric cryptographic primitives that are listed - AES, 3DES, and RC4 - one, RC4, has been shown to be a broken cipher. It is unimaginable that they would be mandating it as one of the three currently permissible. They are weakening national security by doing so!"
These are questions that don't just affect a few people, but just about every Indian who is using the mobile Internet. In its present form, the draft actually severely limits what you can do online, and could hobble the push for a digital India. There's almost a full month to give our feedback, but is anyone listening?

The listing, first spotted by  FindYogi,  doesn't include any images of the handset either.

The listing also claims that the  Nexus 5X supports Quick Charge 2.0. The listing also claims that the  Nexus 5X will runs Android 6.0 Marshmallow out-of-the-box. These  specifications are in line with recent leaks , but  nothing's official until Google's announcement next week.
Recently, new leaked retail box images claimed that the upcoming Nexus smartphones would indeed be called Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P .
